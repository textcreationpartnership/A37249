         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> God himſelf diſtributed thoſe Rights of an Uniformity amongſt the ſeveral Eſtates. And that at diverſe times, and in diverſe manners, according to the ſeveral occaſions of that Society: But yet there are no foot-ſteps to be found of any Humane Collection that ever was made of them. The firſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Greece</hi> were fetch'd from other Countries; but moſt of all from <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was then of moſt Fame and Note, for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wiſdom, and the better ordering of mankind: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all, who would be men of Renown, were wont firſt to Travel; and from whence the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> boaſt, that <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> and the other men of Fame, of thoſe times, derived their Knowledge. And the like is to be ſaid of the <hi>Roman</hi> State; that the moſt ancient ſetled Laws of the Ten Tables (afterwards made Twelve) in the time of the firſt Conſuls were fetch'd from <hi>Greece.

But yet none of them as redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their certain Title, or head of things; nor under the notion of ſuch Rights, ſo belonging to ſuch Perſons, and as concerned in ſuch an Uniformity. Laſt of all, in the Chriſtian Church, all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
<pb facs="tcp:59463:6"/> of Councels, Bodies of Lawes, Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, Syſtemes of Civil Policy, and the like, are full of the recitals and aſſertions of them, and the things belonging to them alſo; but yet ſtill not under their ſpecifical Notion: and there are many defences which have been made of the Doctrine of the ſeveral ſubdivided Profeſſions; and many Rationales, which have been written upon Liturgies, both in the Roman and other Churches: And ſeveral <hi>Irenicums,</hi> which have been occaſionally publiſhed; eſpecially in the <hi>European</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, late called Reformed. But all theſe things, or any other the like, either in the Chriſtian (or <hi>Mahometan</hi>) communion, have not reached the common occaſions of Churches, nor given the laſt and general grounds for pacification. And the interiors, belonging to the explication of the Rights of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, eſpecially of thoſe on the peoples part, have never yet been touch'd upon by any. And theſe then are thoſe Rights which are here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, and ſtated, according to the dictates of the ſeveral ſorts of Laws mentioned and digeſted into their due Connexion and Order.</p>
            <p>This then being the more general matter of this work; the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling it, is accordingly. When we inſcribe it, <hi>of the Conſiſtency of the Eccleſiaſtical eſtate with the Civil,</hi> or of Religion with the Government (which is all one) it is, becauſe that is the thing which we do moſt principally, and deſignedly treat of. The welfare both of Religion and Government, as ſeparately and ſingly taken, being ſuppos'd to it, and as alwayes co-incident with it: And the conſiſtency of Government with Religon being touch'd upon but by the by. And when we entitle it, <hi>Of the Rights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity in Churches;</hi> it is becauſe ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity (in ſome kind of it or other) is the neceſſary and only means for the effecting and preſerving of that Conſiſtency of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with Government; and the Rights belonging to ſuch an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity are the bounds, within which all ought to acquieſs, for that effecting and preſerving of it: which, when they are Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed and Invaded, either by the Prince on his part, then either the Prieſt or People are injured: or elſe by the Prieſt or People on their parts, then there is undutifulneſs and Rebellion practis'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Prince, and mutual Religious Feuds are created and conteſted amongſt the People;

                  <l>— Et, ruptis inter ſe Legibus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbes</l>
                  <l>Arma ferunt —</l>
               </q> So that it is very much for the Common peace and welfare of all affairs amongſt men, that thoſe Rights be duely ſtated, and unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both on the Prince's part, and in order to his affording the Prieſt and People their due; and alſo on the Prieſt and People's
<pb facs="tcp:59463:7"/> parts, and in order to their enjoyment of, and acquieſcence under the Liberties (both external, and internal) belonging to them. And the work it ſelf then is accordingly divided into three Books: to each of them being aſſigned it's proper ſubject matter. In the firſt Book; after the explications and diſtinctions of things laid down, which are common to the whole, I have treated of the Divine Original, both of Religion and Government: which things being ſo primarily Fundamental to the whole body of this Diſcourſe, I did ſuppoſe that men would expect a rational account of them. And I have treated of them more immediatly and principally, in order to the ſtating the Conſiſtency of Religion with Government, in the general, and whoſe charge and Right the Tuition of all three of them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Religion, and Government, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of Religion with Government, is. And within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of theſe things, there are many things co-incident with them which are common to the whole. And as to Religion, in my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing over the diſtinction of true and falſe, particularly, I have laid down the general grounds of all Religions. And as to Government, I have done one thing remarkeable, and that is, I have abſolutely denied the <hi>Jus ad arma,</hi> the right of riſing in Armes (and particularly in defence of matters of Religion, and in oppoſition to the Laws of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity in any State) which is claimed by ſome, both of the Prieſthood, and people; Contrary to what <hi>Grotius</hi> and others of note have done, in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Queſtion: But I have given the Reaſons for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it. And no leſs then the whole conforming Clergie and others in publick imployment of the State at this day in <hi>England</hi> have ſubſcribed to the very ſame matter: And in the end of the ſtating of it I have more explicitly diſputed the tendency of the derivation of Government from the people, and of the Doctrine of Riſing, depending upon it, to the good of Religion, and Humane Society. Which thing, truly, ought to have been done by <hi>Grotius</hi> and others, who have ſtated that queſtion; although in a ſeparate Notion from an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity. In the Second and Third Books, I have treated of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity; the neceſſary means mention'd, for the accompliſhing the Conſiſtency of Religion with Government. In the Second Book I have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it, and the Rights belonging to it, more Generally. And in the Third Book of both of them more particularly. And in both theſe Books, I have taken In the ſeveral Caſes, Queſtions and Quere's belonging to the treating of both thoſe ſorts of things: and in the ſtating both of thoſe Caſes, and of other matters, I have many times conſidered Humane Nature, (ſometimes Tacitly, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſly) and how it is to be dealt with: And he that will not conſider it in ſuch things, is never likely to govern the World. <hi>Omnes,</hi>

               <hi>the nature of men, leaping over the Lawes, doth willingly ſhew it ſelf to do unjuſt things againſt them: Being tranſported by the greatneſs of Anger, more prevalent then Right, and an enemy to the more excellent things.</hi> So that he that will well govern men, muſt do it by firſt Governing humane nature. In my ſtating the more particular Conſiſtency then of Religion with Government, I have taken the beſt care I could, That Religion ſhould have it's due. Neither do I believe, That the particulars concerning either of them, as they ſtand mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this their relative Condition, can well be ſtated otherwiſe then here they are. And one great Reaſon of mens miſtakes and doubts, and diſſatisfactions of Judgement and Conſcience, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Eccleſiaſtical Lawes of Princes, and their ſubmiſſion to them in all Societies, is, their not conſidering of the relation in which Religion ought alwayes in the World to ſtand to the being and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Government, both in Church and State. In my Defence of the Rights of Princes, there are two ſorts of Adverſaries chiefly which I have met with to be oppos'd; and thoſe are the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe of the late <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Presbitery,
<pb facs="tcp:59463:8"/> who have trodden in the ſame ſteps with them in this matter, though under different Notions: and I have not ſpoken any thing concerning either of theſe, either invidiouſly, or at mine own pleaſure; but onely from the Teſtimonials of their own Writings, and Practiſes. And the like I have done, where I have met with any, who have oppoſed the Rights either of the Prieſt or People. In my going through the whole, There are three things, which have cauſed me to deſcend the deeper into the Mines of Labour: And thoſe are, 1. The invention of matter; it being in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wholly new: and almoſt every where, not applied, by any other, to my preſent purpoſe. 2. The digeſting of that matter into it's due Method; It being very various, and the places of connecting and diſpoſing it into its Right Order recurring alſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and in a very various manner. 3. And laſtly, the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Books which I have been forc'd to conſult with, for the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing out of the whole body of this Diſcourſe into the World, but in ſome tolerable manner, and according to the deſerts of the weight of the matter. And thoſe Books, which I have accordingly made uſe of, have been of thoſe profeſſions, which concerne the moſt ſubſtantial matters of the Publick Affairs amongſt men. The firſt of thoſe Faculties, or Profeſſions, is Divinity. And in it, firſt of all, I have attended to the Books of God; the Divine Law of the Old and New Teſtament. And in the Old; for the Interpretation of the Lawes and Ordinances of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what was the external practice of them in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the writings of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Rabbines are ordinarily produc'd, and eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Moſes Maimonides;</hi> Of whom the <hi>Jewes</hi> have a ſaying, <hi>A Moſe ad Moſen non fuit ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis Moſi;</hi> That <hi>from</hi> Moſes <hi>their Maſter, to</hi> Moſes <hi>the Sonne of</hi> Maimony, <hi>there hath not been the like to</hi> Moſes <hi>the Sonne of</hi> Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. And the Rabbinical Age began about the time of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the diſſolution of the Jewiſh Polity by <hi>Titus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Bello Jud. Lib. <hi>7</hi> cap. <hi>24.</hi>
               </note> In whoſe Triumph afterwards at <hi>Rome, Joſephus</hi> mentions only the Book of the <hi>Jews</hi> Law (amongſt whatſoever other Writings they had) to have been preſerved and carried along with him in it. Out of the Books of the Old Teſtament, and the Writings of the Rabbies, there are alſo many late Chriſtian Writers, who have made Syſtematical Collections of the Frame of the Jewiſh Polity; ſuch as <hi>Schickardus,</hi> the Hebrew Profeſſor at <hi>Tubingen; Bertram,</hi> and others. The moſt ſtaple, and authentick Writers in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and next to the new Teſtament it ſelf, are of divers ſorts.<note place="margin">De Jure Belli. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>3. §. 3.</hi> &amp; ad idem alibi.</note> Amongſt the Canons of Counſels, the Canons commonly called the Apoſtles deſerve firſt of all to be mentioned; <hi>Nam in Canonibus antiquiſſimis, qui Apoſtolici dicuntur &amp;c. For in thoſe moſt Ancient Canons, which are called the Apoſtle's,</hi> ſaith <hi>Grotius.</hi> The after Counſels, beſides the large Tomes of them, are Epitomiz'd by <hi>Carranza</hi> in his <hi>Summa Conciliorum, Juſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59463:8"/> and others. And whether the Councels, whoſe Canons I have cited, have been of one ſort or another, either more Primitive, or Papal, or otherwiſe, I have not regarded, ſo long as they have complyed with Right and Reaſon, in the matters to which they have been applicable. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers, and Doctors of the Chriſtian Church, I have made uſe of alſo, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times profeſſedly, but more times only occaſionally. The writings of the School-men are generally Doctrinal, and ſo little to my preſent purpoſe, except it be in the point of Prelacy, in their definitions, and the like. The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories are; in the Jewiſh Church, <hi>Joſephus;</hi> in the Chriſtian, both the more ancient and modern; both thoſe that write more generally, and more particularly of the Affairs of Churches. Laſt of all, the confeſſions, either of the Churches, late called Reformed, or others, ſhew what is their conſent or diſſent in things: And I have ſometimes alſo made uſe of them. The Profeſſion, next to Divinity, which moſt of all concerns the Affairs of Humane Societies, is, that of the Laws. And the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they are the moſt ancient Syſteme of Laws, now extant in the World; ſo alſo they are Divine: and therefore, whereſoever I have aſſerted any thing to be, either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or lawful for Humane Societies, I have been carefull to ſee, firſt, whether it were either eſtabliſhed, or elſe at leaſt permitted by that Law in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> The due reſpects being had ſtill to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the peculiar occaſions of Societies. The ancient Lawes of the more humane and learned Heathen Nations heretofore, and what remains of them, is diſperſed diverſly up and down in their ſeveral remaining writers. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> States are thoſe, which we have the moſt, and moſt received Monuments of. The <hi>Grecians</hi> thought ſo highly of themſelves, that they called all the reſt of the world <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſayes <hi>Herodotus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Euterp. prop. fin.</note> who ſpake not their Language. In <hi>Greece,</hi> the two Famous Common-Weals were that of <hi>Sparta</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and that of <hi>Athens.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Lycurgo.</note> The Famous Law-giver of <hi>Sparta,</hi> ſayes <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and others, was <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> and of <hi>Athens,</hi> were <hi>Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon:</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Solone.</note> And their Lawes were engraven in Tables of Wood, called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: But thoſe Tables of Lawes are now extinct; as alſo the twelve Tables amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> for the moſt part deriv'd from them, as hath been mentioned. Onely there are ſome reputed fragments of them remaining (like the duſt of <hi>Carthage</hi>) and ordinarily annexed to the Code, and Novels of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and the other enſuing Emperours. And the extracts out of the Comments of all the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Lawyers upon them, and the other parts, and ſorts of Laws currant in the Empire, are thoſe, which are collected together, and methodiz'd and digeſted into the Pandects, or Digeſts of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> according to the judgment of <hi>Tribonianus,</hi> and the others imployed in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by him. And the Comments of thoſe ancient Lawyers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:59463:9"/> are now alſo extinguiſhed: Some ſay, by the ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> ſome otherwiſe. But however the defect of them makes roome for thoſe complaints of the Civilians concerning it to this very day, that, if they had been preſerved, they ſhould have had the <hi>Roman</hi> Law from the fountains, and that then, <hi>Fruſtra ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſiſſet Accurſius: To no purpoſe had Accurſius written;</hi> and the like. So then, the body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law is the largeſt, and moſt compleat body of that ſort of Humane Laws, that we have at this day extant in the world. And of it we have made much uſe in the enſuing Book, whereſoever we have come to the quotation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws; and the rather, becauſe of its univerſal currant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in theſe parts of the world; It being received, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, generally in all the Univerſities of <hi>Europe;</hi> And it being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, and conſulted with more or leſs in all the ordinary Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, and ſeveral Dominions of Princes. In the Empire, it is <hi>Lex Terrae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Prax. Civil. Tit. <hi>5.</hi> Conſ. <hi>18.</hi> N. <hi>15.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>The Common Law of the Land.</hi> And it is commonly held by <hi>Gothofredus, Pacianus,</hi> and the other <hi>German</hi> Civilians, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law ought to have the force of Law in all the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories of the Empire. Amongſt the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> almoſt the ſame is its uſe and authority; and ſo more or leſs in the other Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes. But yet notwithſtanding I have in ſome few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars taxed ſome texts of the Civil Law, and that profeſſedly in the principle of natural freedome; as alſo <hi>Grotius</hi> and others follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: And the reaſons of my ſo doing lye open to cenſure. Next in Dignity, to the body of the Civil Law, follows the Code and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and the few other Laws ordinarily annexed to them. And, beſides theſe, alſo I have had occaſion to make uſe of the more particular Civil Laws of Countries: And that, whether ſet forth by the Legiſlative Authority in thoſe Countries, or not; and whether profeſſedly, as ſuch, in a body of Laws; or elſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally mentioned in other writings. Such are the <hi>Capitulare Caroli Magni,</hi> the <hi>Ordines Camerae Imperialis,</hi> and the like. Under the faculty of the Laws, and in conjunction with the Law Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, is comprehended alſo the Law Canon: and the authority of which, in things juſt and regular, ought not to be the leſs regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it is Papal. And both thoſe who compiled the body of it, and annexed it to come within the compaſs of that profeſſion in the Univerſities, intended by it the conſiſtency of Religion with Government, the matters Papal in it being only excepted. And laſt of all, I have had ſome occaſion alſo to conſult with the Chriſtian Doctors upon both theſe ſorts of Laws. Upon the Civil Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, firſt of all, the gloſſes of <hi>Accurſius,</hi> after him <hi>Bartolus,</hi> and his Auditor and Scholler <hi>Baldus,</hi> both of very principal eſteem, and next to <hi>Accurſius</hi> amongſt the Civilians. After them follow <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Peruſinus, Paulus Caſtrenſis, Jaſon,</hi> and others: And after them <hi>Decianus</hi> the <hi>Italian, Antonius Auguſtinus</hi> the <hi>Spaniard; Cujacius,
<pb facs="tcp:59463:9"/> Hottomannus,</hi> and other <hi>French men;</hi> and the like out of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The like have commented alſo on the Canon Law; <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus Brixienſis, Abbas Panormitanus, Didacus, Covarruvias,</hi> and others, ſome of which I have made uſe of. The third and laſt ſort of profeſſion here to be mentioned, is, Phyloſophy; <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Prudences, ordinarily ſo called; and the more principal of them, is, Politicks. And of Politicians, he that bears the name amongſt the ancients, is <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> But, <hi>ſemper excipio Platonem,</hi> and excepting only, that none of the works of Divine <hi>Plato</hi> ought to be detracted from; and whoſe Books of Laws, and his other works contain in them many things, both of the Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the ancient Laws of <hi>Greece.</hi> Amongſt the Moderns, Jeſuites, or others, the learned <hi>Bodine</hi> deſerves an Aſteriſk, as being ſo excellently well ſkilled both in the Civil Law, and alſo in the particular Laws and Policies of Countries. Beſides thoſe, who have written juſt Tracts of Politicks, are others alſo who have debated particular Queſtions in it; ſuch are <hi>Junius Brutus, Buchanan,</hi> the late <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man <hi>Milton,</hi> and others in the queſtion of Riſing in Armes. Next to Politicks, and the prudences concerning the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the matters of Church or State, follow the exemplary pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Hiſtory and Poeſie: And laſt of all, the ſubſervient diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and divers from all theſe mentioned, of Oratory. The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories contain in them many of the notable examples of prudence in Governours, in the ordering the affairs of thoſe Mighty States. The Hiſtories of the Chriſtian Church that follow <hi>Euſebius,</hi> contain the like in Church affairs. Of either the preſent or late condition, both of Churches and States abroad in the world, there are many who give an Hiſtorical account; Such as <hi>Chytraeus,</hi> the Meſſenger of <hi>Maximilian; Georgeviz,</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Captive; <hi>Damianus a Goes,</hi> the Knight of <hi>Portugal;</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Cardinal <hi>Contrarene; Leunclavius,</hi> in his <hi>Annales Turcici,</hi> his <hi>Pandects Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae Turcicae,</hi> and the like. And thoſe Books which principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſtate of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, either as to matters Hiſtorical or Controverſal, I have given an account of in their places hereafter. And of the principal of thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the more general and principal controverſals only in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, for the reaſons in thoſe places mentioned. And, in the laſt place, who will deny, but that the many admirable writings of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman,</hi> both Poets and Orators, are of ſingular uſe many times, both for the profeſſed, and occaſional, both illuſtration and confirmation of things? <hi>Nonne Sexcenti Scriptores, tam Graeci, quam Latini, paſſim</hi> Homeri, Heſiodi, <hi>&amp; aliorum Poetarum exemplis, &amp; teſtimoniis utuntur, ut rei veritatem confirment, horum<expan>

And laſt of all, as to the ſtile in which I have written, I have attended to the two things requiſite, and which ought principally to be heeded in it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> its conciſeneſs, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; its conciſeneſs, that I might rather ſay much in little, then be tedious; and its plainneſs, that I might be underſtood. And in this manner then I have commended this whole enſuing work to the Reader. And if any man think much of thoſe Principles, of which it conſiſts; behold the whole current of times, the Authority of all Laws, and the experiences and practiſes of all Ages (at leaſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in the main) atteſting to them.</p>
            <p>In the interim, that I write not this Book to the vulgar amongſt men, it is ſufficiently evident, both from the matter and form of it. They may, where occaſion requires, and for ſatisfaction of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, be more familiarly inſtructed in the Rights, and Liberties belonging to them in the matters of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity; but otherwiſe, it hath always been their unhappineſs, and ever will be, not to be capable, neither in thoſe matters, nor others, of being rationally dealt with. The very nature then of this diſcourſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth it to the other ſort of men, and particularly to thoſe who have the guidance of others, and the ordinary ſway of affairs in Common-weals in their ſeveral Sphears of activity and ſtations belonging to them, either in the Church or State; that they may ſee the reaſons of thoſe things which are neceſſary for the ſupporting the welfare of Societies, and make the ſeveral uſes of the matters contain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of this Diſcourſe, in order to the Publick Peace.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all then, this being the more general drift, and intent of this whole work; in that poſture (ſuch, ſuch as it is) in which it comes forth into the world; if there be any thing ſaid in it, that is prejudicial, either to Religion or Government, or the conſiſtency of each with either, I wiſh it were unſaid again. In the mean while, I have for ſome time retir'd my ſelf to write it; and have only here further to ſay; May it ſerve the King of Kings in his Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy over men, and Kings and Princes in their Governing of them.</p>

               <p n="4">IV.

In the General, it is ſuch as we have already mention'd; the term being taken at large, and not bounded by any ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions: In the Special it is taken for this or that ſort or kind of Religion; and that whether it be more ſpecial, as it lies at a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance; or leſs, as it lies at a leſſer diſtance from the firſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, according to the rules of Logick. Laſt of all, in the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual it is taken for this or that individual, or particular part of the ſame ſort of Religions, as it is either exerciſed or profeſſed by this or that part of the Profeſſors of it: And ſo is <hi>Rome</hi> one part, and <hi>Verona</hi> or <hi>Florence</hi> another part of the ſame <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ſecond diſtinction of it is,<note place="margin">The Second diſtinction of it.</note> by the two oppoſite members of true and falſe; and the effects of theſe in mens minds and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are either natural or ſupernatural. And this is moſt certainly true, that any falſe Religion, if it be but apprehended to be true, will have <hi>per omnia,</hi> the ſame natural effects in men, together with that which is really true: and as having ſuch are any falſe and erronious ſorts of Religion in the world conſidered by us, when they are mentioned hereafter, and applyed either ſeparately or mixtly to things.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The third diſtinction of Religion is, that it is taken ſimply,<note place="margin">The Third.</note> or relatively; ſimply, when it is conſidered by it ſelf, and only in a

And that Religion is to be conſidered in a relative notion by men very frequently, for the guidance of their actions by it, there needs no more ſaid to evince it, then that it is placed by God in the world, together with other things, which it may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commodate or incommodate, according as it is apprehended of, and uſed or practiſed by them, in relation to thoſe things:

               <p n="7">VII. In the fourth<note place="margin">The Fourth.</note> place, Religion is either National; or not National, and ſecluded: National it is called, by the uſual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the term, when it is the Religion only publickly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Authority in a Country, and then the Church is ſaid alſo to be incorporate into the State: And, not National, is the contrary. Of the former of theſe Sorts, is the Chriſtian Religion in the moſt of the Dominions of <hi>Europe;</hi> In the large Territories of <hi>Preiſter John</hi> in <hi>Affrica:</hi> Of the latter is the Chriſtian, and Jewiſh Religion in <hi>Greece,</hi> and in the moſt of the Dominions of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as is affirmed by <hi>Chytraeus, Johannes Boemus Aubanus, Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieviz, Godignus,</hi> and others. And although it be true, in the mean time, that ſometimes, <hi>De facto,</hi> there are diverſe ſorts of Profeſſors of Religion tollerated in the ſame State (as will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mentioned hereafter) yet none of thoſe have the priviledges, nor extent, ordinarily, of that which is the National, nor cannot properly be called ſo, for thoſe Reaſons, and becauſe ſecluded from thoſe more eminent endowments: But notwithſtanding ſtill all of them have their reſpects ſeverally to the State, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it;<note place="margin">In Declaratione praefix. ad Acta Synodi Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drar.</note>

Of the latter ſort was the care of the Chriſtian Religion in the dayes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and afterwards under the Heathen <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours; and of many Sects afterwards, under the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtian Emperours, and ſuch as are prohibited by them, in the New Civil Law, and the Code and Novells of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> But this caſe is here only pointed at by us, and comes not into ordinary conſideration hereafter: And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59463:17"/> that, becauſe it ſeldome or never happens, that ſuch a Religion ſubſiſts with any duration in any Society; or that, <hi>de jure,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it ought to be endeavour'd in reſpect to ſuch or ſuch a Society: unleſs where there is an immediate and particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from Heaven for it, as there was to the Apoſtles in reſpect to their firſt preaching in <hi>Jury:</hi> otherwiſe the Divines and Civilians do rightly preſcribe to the profeſſors of ſuch a Religion, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Martyrdome, or elſe flight and change of the ſoyle by migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto another Country. And thus much of this firſt general Terme.</p>

                  <p n="18">XVIII. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Nations about it alſo at this day, <hi>(viz.) That Religion is appointed by God.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He general terms then,<note place="margin">Some Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſary to be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to man.</note> which are common to this whole Diſcourſe, being thus firſt of all explicated, I come next to the firſt particular conſideration of things; and that is, of that, firſt in Order, as I ſaid, <hi>(viz.) That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is appointed by God:</hi> and becauſe the being of ſome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the General, for man to practiſe the precepts of, is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as the foundation of its being conſtituted by ſuch or ſuch an Author of it; therefore that is evident from the dictates of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light, concerning the Creation of Man. For, God having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued him with ſuch ſublime faculties of his Soul, as whereby he was capable of practiſing the Precepts of ſuch a Religion; either ſuch a thing as Religion was to be appointed for him to practiſe, or elſe ſuch his natural faculties, (as to that moſt excellent end of them) ſhould have been beſtowed upon him in vain: But God and Nature make nothing in vain.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Precepts then of ſuch Religion, whatſoever they be,<note place="margin">The Precepts of it onely from God.</note> muſt needs proceed Originally only from the appointment and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of God: and that both becauſe God only, on his part, hath the right of preſcribing ſuch Precepts obligatorily, and in the way of Divine Law (ſuch as Religion was ſaid to be above in the definition of it) to man;<note place="margin">Cap. 1. Sect. 2.</note> and alſo becauſe ſuch Precepts in the matter of them, muſt needs be according to Gods will, or elſe they will not be acceptable to him: and if not acceptable, then the obſervation of them, on mans part, cannot bear the notion of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and worſhip; ſuch as it was attributed to it to be, above, alſo, in the explication of the definition.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The Right which God hath of obliging man by Precepts of Religion is two-fold; Firſt, that which belongs to him Primarily as Creator; and ſecondly, ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59463:20"/> as Governour of the world: and therefore it is the firſt General Principle of the Law of Nature, in matters of Religion, that the Creator and Governour of the world is to be ſerved and obeyed:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.3.</note> As it is the firſt Commandment in the Law of <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt have none other Gods before me.</hi> And it is the prime original of all Sabbaths <hi>(i. e.)</hi> times ſet apart for the more ſtated, ſolemn ſervice of God; the remembrance of God as Creator, and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the world: as in the ancient Judical Sabbath, the Creation of the world, and Gods reſting from it to proceed to governing, were aſſign'd as the reaſons of it, And it was the Doctrine of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Athenians,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.24.</note> that God that made the world was to be worſhipped: and as this is the reaſon of Gods Right of preſcribing the Precepts of Religion to man; ſo alike alſo are the reaſons, why the matter of ſuch Precepts, by being according to Gods will, muſt be neceſſarily, on mans part, his Service and Worſhip. For, if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the Iſſue of it will be no leſs then the removal of God from being either a rewarder, or a puniſher of men; and ſo conſequently from having to do at all authoritatively in Humane Affairs: and ſo in the end, all Religion it ſelf towards him, will be deſtroy'd; which would be all one, as to man, as if God's very being it ſelf were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the world. For a reward is for ſomething done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ones will. And, <hi>Paena eſt noxae vindicta; Puniſhment is vengeance taken upon a fault,</hi> ſayes <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpian:</hi> But if Religion, by being according to Gods will, be not mans ſervice and worſhip, there can be no reward annex'd to it from God, nor puniſhment, becauſe he is not wronged, if the precepts of it be violated: and the impulſive cauſe of all Divine Worſhip in man being, naturally, and primarily, Hope and Fear towards a Deity; and good and evil to be expected from him, being the only objects of theſe affections; and the light of Nature, where Divine Revelation is wanting (as it is ſuppoſed to be in this caſe) dictating no other principles of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of good or evil from him, but that of reward for ſerving him, or puniſhment for offending him. If Gods having to do au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively by ſuch rewards and puniſhments be removed from amongſt men, what ground or reaſon would there be left for the practiſing of any Religion at all towards him? and if not towards him, then towards none at all; ſince none elſe but the Creator hath any right of preſcribing it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The conſent of Nations, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God himſelf about it.</note>III. From theſe Grounds and Principles in Nature, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, then it is, that the conſent of Nations hath dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the derivation of all Religion only from God. And the Divine Law alſo hath commanded the ſame thing. In <hi>Moſes</hi> his Preſcript of Worſhip, it is the reaſon prefix'd to the whole Syſtem of his Laws, which were delivered after the Moral Laws, as well as to the two Tables of the Moral Law it's ſelf; <hi>I am the Lord thy God:</hi> and by the ſame Laws, the Idolatry of the Nation was forbidden
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59463:20"/> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as that the preſcribed worſhip of God was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. In the Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he himſelf contra-diſtinguiſh'd the commands of God to the traditions of men:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.9.</note> and his followers practiſed the very ſame Doctrine, and that expreſly upon the very grounds, in Nature, which we have mentioned. There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy. Who art thou that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt another, ſaith St. <hi>James.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays down that maxime,<note place="margin">Chap. 4.12.</note> That, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> and he annexeth the reaſon of his aſſertion; for he that cometh to God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him. The ſame thing concerning duties,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28:</note> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf alſo, before him, hath preſcribed concerning ſins; <hi>Fear not them that kill the body,</hi> but are not able to kill the ſoul; but rather fear him, which is able <hi>to deſtroy both ſoul and body in Hell.</hi> The like hath been the Doctrine of the Heathen Sages alſo, upon theſe very accounts.

So firſt, as to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the moſt ancient Law-giver, (as <hi>Joſephus,</hi> in his time, and when Gentiliſm was ſo rife in the world, durſt avouch him to be, againſt all the Heathen preſcripts:) He received his two Tables written with the finger of God;<note place="margin">Exod. 32.15, 16. <hi>Thargum. in Cant.</hi> Cap. 1.11.</note> and the Judicial and Ceremonial Laws of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the ſame hand, at Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> And it is a Tradition amongſt the Jews, that the Tables were hewn out of the Saphire of the Throne of Gods Glory, which they ſay is mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.10. But I need not inſiſt further upon this particular.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Let us proceed next to the Preſcript of Heathens,<note place="margin">So alſo the Heathen da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theirs.</note> and view their Derivation of their Religion from Divine Authority. The only creditable and authentick Records of former ages, that are left in the World, are thoſe generally of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Timaeo, circa princip:</note> and therefore <hi>Plato</hi> calls the <hi>Greeks</hi> alwayes Children, becauſe of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59463:21"/> the defect of the Hiſtories of former <hi>Ages</hi> amongſt them, that was even in his time: and they being the Elder of thoſe two latter Empires, if any are to be believed concerning the derivation of their Religion, they are.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, as to them, and afterwards we will come to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Herodotus</hi> ſays, That they derived their Religion from the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>

Thus then the univerſal conſent of Nations, and all Divine and Humane Lawes have eſtabliſhed it; That all Precepts and preſcripts of Religion are to be expected only from God, and his divine Authority. But becauſe the Divine Original of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the general, and under it's different Notions, is not only to be aſſerted in relation to the treating of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, and the Rights belonging to it; but alſo that a more ſpecial reſpect is to be had to the true Religion, both by all mixtly, that they may take heed of violating the conſiſtency of it with Government; and alſo by the chief Magiſtrate in particular, and eminently, that he may take care for the ſettling of it as the National Religion in his Society. And becauſe we ſhall have many occaſions hereafter in our following diſcourſe of referring to the diſtinction of Religion into true and falſe; Therefore we will here proceed a little farther in relation to theſe things, and lay down the general grounds of all Religions, and compare them.</p>

The poſitive Divine Laws proceed from God's Supream Soveraignty over man; And that, Primarily, as he is Creator; and by which Soveraignty he is at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to command him any thing elſe alſo, beſides the Law of his Nature,<note place="margin">What the true preſcript of Religion is, is to be known only from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that Authoriz'd by Divine Teſtimony.</note> in thoſe <hi>Mediis Licitis,</hi> which I mentioned upon another account juſt now.</p>

And the ceſſation both of Propheſies and Miracles in the latter ages of the Jewiſh Church, was an argument, that he would have the memory of them, as having been formerly acted, conveyed down by tradition.<note place="margin">Pirkeaboth <hi>Cap. 1.</hi> Vid. &amp; vid.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to his pretended Propheſies, concerning thoſe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Day of Judgment, and his ſecond coming in it, of the Carnal Paradiſe, and the like other matters, up and down in the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> and as he ſtileth himſelf to be, ſo his followers ſtile him to be at this day, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and by way of Eminency, in reſpect to all others, the great Prophet, who was to come into the World; and that both in the ſtricter notion of Propheſie, in reſpect to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, as well as in a larger, in reſpect to his teaching to them their Law of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to his Miracles, it is ſaid he was a Magician; yet we hear little of his particular Miracles.<note place="margin">De Orig. Imper. Turc. Cap. de mirac.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59463:26"/> But he had things in the place of eminent appearances of God with him; ſuch as his Dove at his Ear, his falling ſickneſs Tranſes,<note place="margin">In pandeot Hiſt Turc.

I am only the Meſſenger, to deliver the Law of God to them:</hi> And then he ſayes, he hath wrought enough to convince men. And indeed, in fine, he ſwears Oathes enough to ſtand in the place of all: He ſwears by things viſible, and inviſible; by the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Weſt;</hi> Winds, and Clouds, and Sea, and Starrs, and Angels, <hi>Se Dei Nuncium, non Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, That he is the Meſſenger of God, and no Magician;</hi> and the like other things might be recited.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So alſo as to Tradition. The Original Copy of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Law is ſaid to be kept in the <hi>Chief Mufti's</hi> Cuſtody.

And Tradition is the thing rely'd upon, for the delivery of it at firſt by God to <hi>Mahomet;</hi> as is alleadged; and for it's continued uncorruptedneſs in the precepts of it to this very day.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. In the fourth and laſt place;<note place="margin">So alſo in the Law of Chriſt; And the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion aſſerted from it.

               <p n="1">1. For Propheſie <hi>(viz.)</hi> as atteſting to it; and that in a peculiar manner; and in it, it excell'd all other Religions, and had greater evidence of Divine Teſtimony from it then they had.

                  </note> as ſuch (as I have mentioned) were but a ſecondary Divine Teſtimony, and not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible any further then as atteſted to by Miracles. But the Chriſtian Religion had all the Propheſies concerning the Incarnation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and other<note n="*" place="margin">De Judaeis Chriſtum reji<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientibus. vid.

Luc. 13.34.</hi> Et alibi; &amp; ſic &amp; caeteris.</note> Principal things fulfilled actually, and in the event teſtifying to it. So it excelled all the pretended Propheſies of the Heathens, which were either dark and dubious, and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table either way, according as the event fell out (ſuch as their Reſponſes of Oracles for the moſt part were); or elſe they were concerning things near hand, and which might be foretold, either by Logical concluſions, made by cunning men, concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of them; or elſe by Prae-ſentiments in Nature (ſuch as the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> and others, who write of Prophetick Euthuſiaſme, mention) and from the influence of Natural Cauſes on it; or elſe thoſe Propheſies might be much more from the ſapience and vaſt experience of evil Angels in humane affairs. And ſo alſo it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd <hi>Mahomet's</hi> religion; if he alleadg himſelf to be propheſied of, either by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Books neither of the Old nor New Teſtament, that were any where extant at his appearing in the World, did teſtifie any ſuch thing. If he ſay, they had been corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; neither was there any thing of it in the writings of either
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59463:27"/> 
                  <hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> neither was there any fame of any ſuch thing ever heard of amongſt them: Eſpecially the Chriſtian Religion ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been of no elder date then about ſix hundred years before him; and for the moſt part of that time alſo, its profeſſors having been under the dint of Perſecution; and ſo there being little likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that they either ſhould have had opportunity of corrupting, in ſo great a meaſure, the Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> concerning his coming, in ſo little time; or elſe ſhould have been at leiſure, or in a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind to do it, under ſuch perſecution. And laſt of all, what end can it poſſibly be ſuppoſed, they ſhould have had in the doing of it? The like alſo is to be ſaid of his own perſonal Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of the day of Judgment, and his ſecond Coming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> after a thouſand years; and how much the Propheſies of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion excelled them.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> in his Travels into <hi>Perſia.</hi> pag. 159.</note> Which Propheſies of his how well they have been fulfill'd, the event ſhewes; For lately the time being expired, his ſecond Coming was very ſeriouſly look'd for: and the people, ſeeing themſelves gull'd, began to ſtagger; till the <hi>Mufti</hi> aſſured them that the figures were miſtaken, and that it was two thouſand in the Original. And the Grand <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> till then, kept his eldeſt Daughter a Virgin, and a horſe ready in his Stable for him; which after that he diſmiſſed. So that thus have been, either the pretended, or real propheſies, atteſting to other Preſcripts of Religion; but not ſo thoſe atteſting to the Chriſtian. It hath been atteſted to by Prophetick Heathens; as is evident from the writings of the <hi>Sybills,</hi>

So ſome by others, before he was of any Age, or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſſembling them; as his being born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Judea,</hi> his coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, ſome by perſons, who were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being ſuborned by any man; as the little children ſaluting him with <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> Nay, ſome by the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves, the utter enemies of his being the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> and that at unawares; as their giving thirty peeces of Silver for him, their not breaking his Legs

               <p n="2">2. In the like manner alſo did the Chriſtian Religion excel in Miracles. <hi>Moſes</hi> derived his power of working them from God; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought them as God, and in his own name. <hi>Moſes</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the common death of all men; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> roſe again, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven.

So alſo he excell'd the Heathen, and all their pretended Miracles; and that, remarkably, in his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing their Oracles, the great pillars and ſupports of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Religion, and in other things. So alſo he exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>led <hi>Mahomet;</hi> who did not ſo much as pretend the working of many Miracles;<note place="margin">Supra: Sect. <hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> as is ſaid; but that he was to come with Armes, for the Propagation of his Preſcript of Religion. And theſe Miracles alſo,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Alcoran.

And their followers, in the ſucceeding ages, appealed to all the world, to behold the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles accompanying them; and that continuedly, for many Centuries and Ages together.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſtly. The Tradition of all theſe things hath been. 1. True in the root, and Spring-head of them. 2. Uninterrupted in the ſtream, and derivation of them alſo down all along the Ages of the Chriſtian Church. There is no way for the proof, and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of things amongſt men, but by the Teſtimony of witneſſes; which was the laſt way preſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, and is by all Lawes of Countries in the world.<note place="margin">Vid.

And that men are oblig'd to conſent and ſubmit to Government, both in the general, and in the ſpecial, or any of the lawful ſorts of it; and alſo in the particular, or individual; it is both from the Law of Nature, which dictates ſuch their conſent and ſubmiſſion to be yeelded by them; and alſo from the expreſs Divine Law, which commands it from God. And as it is thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Government in the State, ſo alſo it is concerning Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church, in any Society; That men, either entring into, or elſe being already in the Society of any Chriſtian Church, are oblig'd to conſent to the lawful Government of it, in theſe wayes mention'd. And they do alſo farther oblige themſelves to conſent, and ſubmit to it, more ſpecially, and expreſsly by their particular Acts of receiving Baptiſme in ſuch a Church, partaking in Church Priviledges, by Subſcriptions, Church-Oathes, and the like. And the like is to be ſaid every way concerning the State, in it's capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in relation alſo to theſe things, in their ſeveral reſpects, which they bear to it; and as to their obliging men to acquieſs under the Government of it. And laſt of all, that conſent once given in all theſe ſorts, and reſpects of it, doth oblige men to yeild their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and obedience due to Governours, and Government by it; it is remarkeably evident from the dictate of the Law of Nature. For, where right accrues neceſſarily to another (as in this caſe it doth to Government) by a mans own voluntary Act; That Act being once paſſed, a man cannot reverſe, or revoke that right due by it again. And the obligation induc'd upon men by conſent, in the general, all lawes have ever Aſſerted: and both in the Canon and Civil Law there is no appeale granted from Arbiters choſen by the parties Litigant: And the Doctors of both Lawes do conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjuſt the ſame things. <hi>Ab arbitris appellatio permiſſa regulariter non eſt,</hi> That <hi>from Arbiters there is no appeal permitted Regularly,</hi>

In the controverſie,<note place="margin">The two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes aſſigned, from whence the Civil Power is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, in the controverſie concerning it</note> concerning the original of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there are two conſtitutive and principal efficient cauſes of the Civil Power aſſigned. The one is God, and his immediate donation of it. The other is the People, and their Authoritative donation of it: And both are alledged. And becauſe that this Principle of the authoritative donation of the people, in this caſe; is directly oppoſite to the immediate donation of God; and that alſo there are many dangerous conſequences, and ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the very conſtitution of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity in particular, and the Laws of it (and particularly the right of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Armes) which are derived from this authoritative donation of the people mentioned; therefore alſo I will here farther ſtate the Caſe concerning both theſe matters.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. The ſtate of the caſe then concerning the derivation of the power of Government from the people, is thus;<note place="margin">The ſtate of the Queſtion concerning the derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it from the people.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A Primitive liberty of all men by nature, is laid down as the Ground and Foundation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The people, by their conſent given, are ſaid to confer the power of Civil Government over them on their Governours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Governour ſet up by them, is ſtated, not as a Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but only as the peoples Uſufructuary, and Tenant at Will, in the mean time, in his Government.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The power of Government is ſaid to remain fundamentally (as they call it) all the while in the people; and only the exerciſe of it, for the preſent, to belong to the Governour.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The conſequence derived from hence, is, that the people therefore may reſume it in caſe of Male-adminiſtration, and reduce all things again to the ſtate of Nature (as they call it) till another is ſet up.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That they may uſe the means, and exerciſe the right of Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, riſing in Armes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the depoſing the Prince guilty of ſuch Male-adminiſtration, if occaſion be.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And Laſtly, All this is ſaid to be appointed by God and Nature, for theſe ends <hi>(viz.)</hi> The wellfare of Religion, and the ſafety of Humane Society from Tyranny. Theſe then are the things that in our derivation of the Magiſtrates Power immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and authoritatively, in a ſpecial manner (and not only by the concurrence of his general Providence, as our opponents ſay) from God, come firſt to be examined.</p>
               <p n="10">X. Firſt then,<note place="margin">The principle of Natural Freedom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> the principle of Univerſal Natural freedom is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by our opponents, in this matter, as the Law of Nature, from two Fountains or Spring-heads of things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt from the Civil Law.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the Publick care of Religion is not (in Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) the proper and ſupream charge of any private perſon (as ſhall be hereafter evidenc'd:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</note>) and therefore he that ſhall undertake to make uſe of this extream means of open Riſing in Armes for the Publick Safety, and Defence of it (beſides the ſimple ſinfulneſs of the means uſed) ſhall introduce himſelf into another mans Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and meddle with that which is not required at his hands. If any man ſay here that he is bound to take the Magiſtrate upon him; What? in oppoſition to the Magiſtrate; and to the uſe of his Power and Faculties? This will meet with all the difficulties that have been already mentioned; and in the conſideration of this caſe of Riſing in the general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The undoubted ſtrain of the Chriſtian Religion, particularly, is abſolutely againſt this Principle, and pretence mentioned: <hi>(viz.)</hi> it appoints not propagation of Religion to be made by the ſword. That is <hi>Mahomets</hi> Law,<note place="margin">In Alcoran.</note> 
                  <hi>In Nomine Dei boni viri pugnent: In the Name of God let good men fight,</hi> ſays he, although not in the caſe mention'd neither.

                  <hi>Omnia prius tentanda, That the utmost is firſt to be tryed,</hi> and the like, are frequent; yet theſe particulars do not well accord with them.

               <p n="2">2. Let us compare then with theſe things the miſchiefs which are ordinarily to be expected from the peoples part of this queſtion its being held and taught: And thoſe are frequent Riſings; ſo often generally, as Ambitious, Covetous, or the like ſort of perſons (of which there are always ſome in all Societies) ſhall have a mind to Innovate: Thoſe are alſo the publick deſolations both amongſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, which do uſe to be made at ſuch Riſings: Thoſe are the loſs of the lives of Princes by maſſacre, of Nobles in the field: Thoſe are the raiſing Civil Wars, and that becauſe there are opinions ordinarily for the Princes part, as well as for the peoples, in ſuch a claſhing of affairs; and thoſe cauſed by all the ſorts of motives to them, both by Conſcience, Affections and Intereſts, as well as any other opinions whatſoever. But the miſchiefs of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War are far worſe ordinarily, then any ſort of Tyranny: ſuch are alſo, by all theſe things, the perpetual unhinging, and unſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Humane and Divine affairs, and the like: And finally, the rendring the Chriſtian Religion (which ſhall be ſuppoſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate ſuch Riſings in armes in the caſes mentioned) inconſiſtent with Government by all theſe matters. And it is but in vain, that <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> endeavours to ſecure thoſe caſes by limitations, to be obſerved by them that Riſe;<note place="margin">Infra Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> ſince the corruptions of men (of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of on purpoſe, and more at large hereafter) do not uſe to act by Rule, and logical diſtinctions in the world, as was ſaid before in the caſe of pretences for Riſing:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hic ſupra.</hi> §. 12.</note> and corrupt men (for whom theſe caſes of Conſcience amongſt others are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) are ſuppoſed generally not to proceed by any thing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59463:46"/> at all: So then, if theſe evils be greater then the evils of the ſuppoſed caſes of Tyranny, (if a Prince ſhould be permitted to act them) The Concluſion is, that it is better both for Religion, and all humane Society, that the affirmative part of the Queſtion be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther held, and taught, then the negative.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. Let us come to a fourth Argument for it alſo;<note place="margin">The fourth Argument, from a further compariſon of things.</note> and that is to be taken from the compariſon of which of theſe parts of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion there being held and taught, hath actually, and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally been the moſt occaſion of evil to Religion, and humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: whether the one, by its having been the occaſion of the moſt frequent, and moſt deſtructive Tyrannies in Princes; or the other, by it's having produc'd the moſt frequent, and deſtructive ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings? And who is there, that hath read Hiſtories, and obſerved this particular in humane affairs, that will not vote the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by riſing (both as to their quality, and number; and both in reſpect to divine, and humane affairs,) to have been the greater, and more to be bewayled many to one? Let any one compare theſe things generally amongſt men.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. The fifth and laſt Argument we will lay down from one more particular Compariſon; of which is beſt to be Governed,<note place="margin">The fifth and laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from one more particular compariſon of things.</note> and with-held from damnifying the publick <hi>(viz.)</hi> either a Prince, if actually exerciſing Tyranny, or a multitude, if up in Armes to ſuppreſs it? A Prince exerciſing Tyranny, is a ſingle perſon ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily; A multitude, and the corrupt men in it many: A Prince is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain definite Perſon; the Ambitious, or otherwiſe corrupt men in a multitude many times lie hid, till their deſignes intended are wrought, and ripened beyond the help and recovery of others: However they are at all times indefinite, becauſe no man is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to be truſted in a Temptation. It is for the Princes dammage many wayes, if he ſhould put a Tyranny in Practice; he loſeth his Subjects hearts, and their perſons, in both which his ſtrength and ſafety conſiſteth every way; he incurres the danger of Riſings againſt him, Aſſaſſinations, and the like: But the Ambitious, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe corrupt members of a multitude, are prompted by hopes of getting, and that even the Princes Crown, which doth uſe to be more valued by ſuch men, then a Crown of Starres in Heaven: And laſtly, a Prince may be perſwaded (if he be a man of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) by his Divines; If not by them, by others upon the account of other reſpects, to deſiſt from Tyranny; but there is no dealing with a multitude by any of theſe wayes.</p>

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:59463:49"/>V. Firſt then,<note place="margin">Firſt in the general.</note> this neceſſary negative conſiſtency of any True Religion with Government in the general, will be evident from this Categorical Syllogiſme, containing the ſenſe of our former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning theſe things, <hi>(Viz.)</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>Thoſe things which are appointed by God to have a being together in the World amongst men, muſt needs be in themſelves totally negatively conſiſtent amongſt them:</p>
                     <p>But the True Religion is ſo appointed by God to have ſuch a being, together with government in the world amongst men; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must needs be in it ſelf totally negatively conſiſtent with it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition in the preſent Argument is not taxable; and he that will deny the <hi>Major,</hi> and aſſert any two Ordinances of God whatſoever (ſuch as any True Religion and Government are) to be in themſelves, although but in any one ſingle reſpect, and particular whatſoever, mutually inconſiſtent in the world; he muſt needs accuſe God himſelf of a defect in his very act of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them there. For, if God hath placed things in the world, with an intent of their conſiſting,<note place="margin">Supra Cap. <hi>1.</hi> §. ult.</note> and continuance there (as was above concluded concerning Religion and Government,) and is from moſt weighty and apparent Reaſons evident to all that he hath done ſo (concerning thoſe things) and yet they will not conſiſt; then we muſt of neceſſity fall to the taxing his very attributes, which were operative in the placing them there. Where was his omniſciency, that had no farther inſight into what he did? Where was his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that could no better contrive? Or where was his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, that could no better effect? If he were at any time deficient in theſe; at that time he had not <hi>the Attributes of a God:</hi> And if he had them not, he was no God; and if there were any time in which he was not a God, it is impoſſible that at any time he ſhould be a God; without utter confuſion denounced, by him that will ſay the contrary, to all the Right Philoſophy and Divinity, that ever concern'd a God in the world. So that it appears in Sun Beams, that he will enervate our preſent Argument, muſt in the laſt reſult, remove any ſuch thing as a God-head out of the world: but we will not imagine ſuch a ſtrain of Atheiſm. So then the proof of this Argument in the general, includes the proof of the neceſſary total negative conſiſtency of the Chriſtian Religion in particular, with any Lawful Government. And it evinceth the like conſiſtency of any preſent Lawful Government alſo, either in Church or State, with the ſame Chriſtian Religion, upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Governours, in whoſe hands the exerciſe of ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is, do proceed rightly, and by right rules, in their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it.</p>

We deſcend next then to the proof of both the poſitive, and eminent conſiſtency of the Chriſtian Religion with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lawful Government in any Society: And that either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion either of ſpecial or individual. And for that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it muſt needs conſiſt poſitively, will be evident from both its ſtamping the preſent Lawful Government, both in Church and State, as hath been mention'd, with Divine Authority, for the rendring of it more Sacred amongſt men; and alſo from its teaching men to be both Good Citizens and Subjects, in all the Duties of the ſecond Table, which are the compleat duties of Humane Society. Many things more particularly might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd:<note place="margin">De Jure Belli. Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>20. §. 49. &amp;c.</hi> Vid. Ibid.</note> But well ſaith <hi>Grotius,</hi> concerning the whole Syſtem of the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion in the general; <hi>Nihil eſt in Diſciplina Chriſtiana, quod Humanae Societati noceat, immo quod non proſit: We may be ſure of that, That there is nothing at all in any of the Precepts of the Chriſtian Religion, which doth any wayes hurt, nay, which doth not help and profit Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It's poſitive eminent Conſiſtency is as obvious to any man: The Chriſtian Religion being the very band and tye of Humane Society. For, whereas the Governour, in his Humane Capacity, can enjoyn the Duties of the ſecond Table, onely under Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Penalties; God doth in the Chriſtian Religion enjoyne them under Eternal: And, whereas the Governour, in recompence to the obſervation of thoſe Duties, can promiſe onely Temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; God doth in the Chriſtian Religion, promiſe alſo Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal: And, whereas the Governour can take Cognizance only of the overt, open acts of diſobedience to his Commands; God doth in the Chriſtian Religion alſo, take Cognizance of the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions of the heart, and firſt ſtirrings of it towards ſuch acts of diſobedience, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thoughts, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Scripture: So that, who ſees not, that the Chriſtian Religion hath ribb'd Humane Society with Adamant; and is the very Cement, and Band, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of it, in all reſpects; and the Superlative, and moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Help and Support to the preſent Lawful Governour in any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety whatſoever?</p>

And laſtly then, I have but this one laſt and ſhort Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Conſectary to lay down from theſe things: And that is, That if at any time the Chriſtian Religion doth prove ſubverſive of the preſent Lawful Government, and by any occaſion taken by men from it, in any manner of way whatſoever; it is from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of thoſe men, and their humane mixtures obtruded upon it, and not from any genuine Rules or Precepts of the Chriſtian
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59463:50"/> Religion it ſelf. The purer Sun containeth no ſuch Clouds; and the ſpects ſhewed in the Jewel are but ſpots of dirt. God himſelf, as he would never have appointed a Religion in it ſelf, ſubverſive of his own Ordinance of Government; ſo he could not ordinarily have expected, that the Kings and Governours of the Earth, if ſuch, and as rational men only, ſhould have received it as his. We proceed then from hence, to other things.</p>

Such alſo have been the late Controverſies nearer home about many points in Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and concerning the modes of ſervice, and the like. But I need not ſay any more for the evidencing this matter, ſince it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obſervable from the experience of all Ages, concerning the Hereſiarks in ſeveral Countries and Churches, when they have had any Hereſie to ſpread, or any ends to ſerve in a ſchiſme; That they have not thought they have done enough, unleſs, beſides the grand Hereſie of their Sect, they have had alſo certain differences in leſſer things (cry'd up for greater) by which to diſtinguiſh their parties, and to keep them at a more compleat and farther diſtance from others. So <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as hath been mentioned, beſides what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59463:61"/> he hath done in the grand aſſertion of his Prophetical Office,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Supra Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. §. 7.</note> hath diſtinguiſh'd himſelf alſo by many other things, from the followers of Chriſt. So alſo the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> beſides what ſhe hath done in the derivation of the fundamental Papal Rights from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> hath diſtinguiſhed her ſelf from other Chriſtian Churches by other leſſer matters, and the like. And the like other inſtances might be given. The Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the New Teſtament, have enjoyn'd moderation and meekneſs, and the like, in caſe of difference about ſuch things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. and forbidden doubtful diſputations before the weak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. But men have proſecuted them with Fire and Sword: But yet here is a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made of Doctrines inconſiderable in themſelves, and ſuch as are made conſiderable by accident in any caſe. Such may be the leſſer Doctrines in any Church, when the Churches Lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reſpect, that is to be given to their Government, depends upon the defence of them. Such may be alſo the Doctrines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted either in Churches, and more particularly by the members of them mutually; or by Churches, and betwixt them more publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But in either caſe, however they ought not to be ſo unlawfully conteſted, as we have ſaid, and to the greater prejudice of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of humane affairs.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. In the ſecond place;<note place="margin">The ſecond ordinary cauſe.</note> the ſecond ordinary cauſe of ſuch contentions amongſt men, is the great variety of opinions, that is amongſt them, eſpecially amongſt the vulgar, and more illiterate, heedleſs ſort of men, if they come once to ſit in the chair of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And all that variety proſecuted by as various and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ſorts of Zeal alſo.

But in the mean time, as to the Scripture, in this matter (although ſome things in it be hard to be underſtood, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.) yet it hath declared (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays) the Doctrine neceſſary to Faith and Manners,<note place="margin">De Doctr.

                  </note> ſo plainly, as that by comparing of Scriptures, and the diligent uſe of a mans Reaſon, and of the other means which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this caſe, (for theſe things are required) the natural knowledge of them may be certainly arrived at. And any Church alſo is ſuppoſed, in its ſetting forth of any Rule, or Canon, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, according to its occaſions, to declare the ſenſe of Scripture in all things in it, as plainly as it can: But however, all men are not capable of making the due uſe of theſe, or the like means of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: And generally they do, and ever will differ in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <note place="margin">Liberty of judgment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed and defined.</note>IV. Liberty of Judgment, in matters of Religion, comes under a two-fold diſtinction. Firſt, it is diſtinguiſhed according to the two different ſorts of objects of the intellectual faculty in man: And ſo it is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That of the practical judgement, in relation to actions, and things to be done.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That of the ſpeculative, in relation to things to be believed; and thoſe either matters of Faith, or matters of Opinion, as thoſe terms are ordinarily underſtood by Divines.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is to be diſtinguiſhed either in reſpect to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lying upon the intellectual faculty, and conſequently on the will, to aſſent and conſent to things; (to aſſent to things ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to conſent to things practical) or elſe in reſpect to the bare exerciſe and imployment of it, in order to the fixing ſuch aſſent and conſent mentioned. And the firſt of theſe is ordinarily called, <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Liberty of the Judgement of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning.</hi> Liberty of Conſcience, ſo taken, reſpects principally mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters practical; and ſo it conſiſts in conſcience, it being free from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to any thing, except the commands of God. And that it is ſo free, ſays the Scripture, <hi>James</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. And thoſe commands of God are either mediate, or immediate. And liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Judgement of diſcerning, reſpects both matters practical and ſpeculative univerſally; and conſiſts in its being free from any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59463:68"/> of its being exerciſed about thoſe things. But ſtill both theſe ſorts of liberty, being things internal, they alſo cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be diminiſhed, nor taken away by man, neither do they in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves concern Humane Society.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That this liberty of exerciſing the Judgment of diſcerning,<note place="margin">The liberty of exerciſing mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> as it is largely taken, and in the general, about all matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is, and always hath been conceded by God to men; it is evident both from the light of Nature, and from the Divine Law: And the uſe and enjoyment of it is a grand natural right belonging to men.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is evident from the light of nature; in that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have endued man with ſuch Judgment of diſcretion, for this very end, that he might uſe and exerciſe it in all things indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And ſo upon that account he is obliged to do it, whereſoever occaſion requires. And if in all things that concerns him and his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, then in matters of Religion eſpecially; or elſe ſuch judgment ſhould be beſtowed, as to thoſe moſt weighty things, upon him in vain. It is the ſaying of <hi>Cicero,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, from the Divine Law, in that it doth every where ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe and command the uſe of ſuch judgment of diſcerning in matters of Religion to men, and where they properly concern them.

The diſtinction of perſons here concerning it, is, that of men divided into the vulgar, and more intelligent. And this diſtinction of them is common to all Societies. The diſtinction of things,<note place="margin">Hic ſupra §. <hi>2.</hi> Supra Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>1. §. 7.</hi>
                  </note> and matters of Religion, are partly thoſe here already mentioned; and partly heretofore <hi>(viz.)</hi> of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, into Doctrines of Belief, and Doctrines of manners: And thoſe of Belief, into Doctrines of Faith, and Doctrines of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: And both thoſe of Belief and Practiſe, either into Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines more or leſs Fundamental; and conſequently either more or leſſe concerning the Good of men; and then no wonder if conſequently alſo, either more plainly or more obſcurely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture: And thoſe alſo concerning the good of men, either ſo concerning it ordinarily, and in themſelves; or elſe by accident, and in ſome particular caſe; and as to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons: And that good alſo either their temporal, in this world, in a leſs eminent notion; or their eternal in another, in a more eminent. And, according to theſe diſtinctions both of perſons and things, is the uſe of this liberty in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in all Societies to be limited: And that as it reſpects the laſt end, which was mentioned, of all Society, the common good of Humane Affairs: and that is, that to perſons intelligent, and who are ſufficient to judge of ſuch things, God and Nature have allowed the liberty of the ordinary exerciſe of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſcerning univerſally, and according to the latitude of its adequate object, and in relation to all the ſorts of Doctrines mentioned; and that for many reaſons, relating both to the good of Religion and Government, and the Conſiſtency of Religion with Government: But to the Vulgar, and perſons inſufficient actually,<note place="margin">Infra Lib. <hi>3.</hi> Cap. <hi>13.</hi> §.</note> and ordinarily not ſo, as ſhall be more particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd hereafter.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Liberty of outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be regulated by Humane Laws.</note>VII. Liberty of Profeſſion, and outward actions, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, is a thing clearly different from theſe two ſorts of Liberty already mentioned. And becauſe the uſe of it, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and in it ſelf, cometh under the cognizance of men; and in its effects alſo, reacheth to their perſons and affairs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be regulated by Humane Lawes.

               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59463:69"/>
               <p>This liberty of Profeſſion, and outward Actions, as to matters of Religion, is that which hath been uſed in all Ages, to have been falſly cry'd up by corrupt men, either for Chriſtian Liberty, or liberty of Conſcience, according as either would ſerve their turns, when they have affected any Innovations or Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, either Eccleſiaſtical or Civil in any Society. And li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of divulging mens Judgements or Opinions in matters of Religion, is one maine part of this liberty of outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII.

And therefore it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the uſe of the means of Grace, by which ſuch Grace is ordinarily to be attained, ought by the Chief Magiſtrate in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity to be conceded to the people. And they have a Right to it both by the Natural and Divine Law: By the Natural, as the means is neceſſary to the end in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: and by the Divine, as thoſe particular means are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, as neceſſary to that particular end. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> ſaith the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17.</note>

               <p>They held for Tenents all the other the moſt incongruous Precepts of their Religon: and were eaſily led, either by their Prieſts, or others, to the holding of them. The like in the Religion of the <hi>Jewes</hi> at this day: They have the Doctrines of their Religion deliver'd to them concerning the dayes of their <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> That <hi>then they ſhall
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59463:72"/> have a ſumptuous Banquet provided for them</hi> (viz.) <hi>out of a Bull of the Mountains, created and fatted for this very end, which ſhall be able to eat up the Graſs of a thouſand Mountains in one day; and every night it ſhall grow up again. And out of the Fiſh</hi> Leviathan, <hi>and the Bird</hi> Juckna, <hi>one Egge of which is of that Bigneſs, that, if by chance it were caſt out of the neſt, it were enough to beat down three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cedars, and to drown with it's liquor Sixty Villages.</hi> The like Doctrine they have concerning other things. And although <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe Ben Iſrael,</hi> and others, their later more learned Rabbies,<note place="margin">De Reſurecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one lib. <hi>11.</hi> cap. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret theſe things in a Parabolical and Spiritual ſence; yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People in all Ages have made no Bones to ſwallow down the belief of the letter of them, and to take it (like the <hi>Mahometan's</hi> Paradiſe) for their happineſs in another World. The like alſo in the Religion of the Turks:<note place="margin">Avierus. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi> Johan Leo lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>12.</hi> Aphric.</note> Mahomet <hi>had but his Alcoran bound up in a handſome Volume, and cauſed a Wild Aſs to be taken, and the book to be tyed about his neck; and as he Preach'd, upon a ſudden fell into a Rapture, as if ſomething had been revealed to him from Heaven, and ſo preſently brake out, and told the people, That God had ſent them a Written Law from Heaven, and let them go to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, and they ſhould find it tyed about an Aſſes neck; and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently received it.</hi> And as for their Reward, for the obſervation of his Law, he delivered to them the low and homely Parable of the Ramm,<note place="margin">Bernard. in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar. part. <hi>1.</hi> Serm. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>at the end of the world he ſhould be transform'd into the likeneſs of a mighty Ramm; and all behung with Locks, and long flieces of Wool; and that they ſhould be as Fleaes ſheltering themſelves in them; and that he would give a leap into heaven, and ſo convey them all thither.</hi> And theſe things ſtill as matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Faith, were ſo allowed well enough, even in their groſs and literal ſence, by the ſimple people. Laſt of all the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion alſo is not free from the mixture of the like groſs impoſtures in ſeveral parts of the World, where it is profeſſed. He that will take a view of the wild practices of the late <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> of the deceipts and fopperies of <hi>Rome;</hi> of <hi>Muncer's</hi> laughing, and crying out, (when he was pulled with red hot Pincers for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the People) that <hi>they would have it ſo;</hi> of the weepings and Miracles of Images in the Romiſh Church; of the Indulgences and Sales of Pardons up and down in the ſtreets, and market places of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and the like things; will quickly acknowledg it. And other Eaſtern Churches have the like in them alſo. And finally, abundance of theſe things are at this day experimented upon the ſimple people in other Religions alſo. The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Perſian Mahometans;</hi> the ſeveral ſorts of the <hi>Gentues</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> diſperſed up and down in all the Provinces of <hi>India,</hi> both within and without <hi>Ganges,</hi> the vaſt Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Japan,</hi> and the like Eaſtern Countries, ordinarily deſcrib'd by Hiſtorians and Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; are all of them great inſtances of theſe things. Their <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:59463:73"/> or <hi>Prieſts,</hi> teach them the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Doctrine of Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of Souls; and they nouriſh Apes and Monkies to receive them at their Death. They teach the women to be voluntarily burnt or buried alive at the Funerals of their Husbands; and they alſo being ſo taught, contend earneſtly amongſt themſelves which of them ſhall take that cruel lot; and ſo are zealous Suicides. And the like other things, are recited concerning them, and their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes alſo heretofore,<note place="margin">Vid. Polyhiſt: Cap. <hi>65.</hi> De Indiâ.</note> by <hi>Julius Solinus</hi> and others. And any the like Doctrines which their Prieſts deliver to them are as eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by the ſimple vulgar. So that thus it is with the vulgar, as to the firſt part of the Magiſtrates Charge, they being weak and fit to be lead. And this is yet further obſervable concerning them, that they are ſo alwayes rul'd by Shewes and Cuſtomes; That when any where there happens a Change of Religion (and be the change of it in it ſelf, never ſo abſur'd, and never ſo much oppos'd by them at it's firſt ſetting up; yet) if it be but accompanied with fair ſhewes, and good pretences, Cuſtome, ſometimes in a very little time, but alwayes ordinarily in one Age, will make any Religion currant with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The like Errors they are apt to run and be led into alſo in reſpect to Government, either Eccleſiaſtical or Civil; either of themſelves, or by theſe Pretences, and Cuſtome. The <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, in the ſeveral mutations and hazards of their Governments, are full of examples in this kind. And the People ſtill have been drawn either to obedience by their Governours; or to Rebellion by the Leaders of Factions, by theſe things. And the pretences of Reformation, and liberty of Conſcience, and Chriſtian liberty, as to matters of Religion, and of liberty of the Subject in matters Civil, have been the common Lures of all Innovators, by which they have drawn them to them in all Ages and Societies. So in the Sacred Records, and under the Government of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the people oftentimes ran themſelves into Murmurings, Tumults, and the like,<note place="margin">

                  </note> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> their Church and State Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And although the Politicians uſe to ſay, That a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, without ſome one to lead them, is not to be eſteemed of; yet when they are either in ſuch actual madneſs, or in a diſpoſition to it, it is ſeldome that there wants ſome head or other to lead them. So alſo the company of <hi>Corah</hi> were led away by him, under Pretence of Religion; and in <hi>Davids</hi> time the followers of <hi>Abſalon</hi> by him, under the pretence of Liberty of the Subject. So <hi>Herodotus</hi> recites it concerning <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> that he recovered his Tyranny, which he had loſt, at <hi>Athens,</hi> by putting a Woman, one <hi>Phya,</hi> into the Habit of the Goddeſs <hi>Minerva,</hi> and by having her driven along the ſtreets in a Chariot to the Temple of the Goddeſs by ſome crying before her, O ye <hi>Athenians</hi> receive again <hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> whom <hi>Minerva</hi> her ſelf brings back to you! and the people preſently performed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59463:73"/> Honours to the Woman, and received <hi>Piſiſtratus.</hi> So alſo the Roman Senate, in <hi>Livie,</hi>

               <p n="9">IX. There are certain Doctrines in the Chriſtian Religion, which are indeed of great moment as to the ſpiritual man, but are diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted variouſly by the ſeveral ſubdivided Profeſſions in the Chriſtian Church; and thoſe are the Doctrines of <hi>Special Grace, Spiritual blindneſs,</hi> the <hi>enmity of the natural man,</hi> and the like.

They have aſ. ſerted and reputed their parties only to have had ſpecial Grace, and others to have been Carnal men: And if thoſe others have not ſeen any reaſon for their wayes, they have ſaid it hath been, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſpiritually blind: and have been ready to apply that of the Apoſtle to their Caſe, if our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.

And hence it is that the way concerning theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, amongſt us now vulgarily called Arminian, hath been by ſome Chriſtian Churches countenanced and aſſerted, or at leaſt not much diſcountenanced, nor contradicted. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſolemnly profeſſed it, and the main of it.

And as to theſe Doctrines, and ſo farre forth as they are concerned here, certainly that way of Tenent concerning them is to be looked upon as truth, and as intended by the Scripture, and accordingly to be choſen by all Churches, which tends leaſt to Diviſion, and moſt to the Promotion of the welfare of the Publick Charge of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity.</p>

And as to Interpretations, the Rules of Prudence and general Equity are to be adhibited: And then no man, by any Law or precept whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59463:80"/> is bound to apply himſelf ſo wholly to the buſineſs of any Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that times and Vacations for the Performance of other due Offices,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.16, 17.</note> as occaſion requires, are allowed.

So that thoſe that ordinarily ſay, That Religion and the Function of the Miniſtry deſerve and require the whole man; if they mean Primarily and in reſpect to the intention of the mind, as imploy'd in the Acts of either, they ſay truly: But if in this ſence we have mention'd, they ſpeak only popularly, but not Truly.

So there were alwayes amongſt the Heathens, in their Church So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, as we have partly already mention'd, and as is to be ſeen in the ſeveral Heathen Hiſtories and relations of theſe things: And ſo there muſt of neceſſity be in all other Churches.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. As to the Chriſtian Church, there are divers ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Church Governours and Eccleſiaſtical Perſons mentioned in the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Teſtament, and aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the Ancient Councels, the Canon Law, the generality of Interpreters of Scripture, and the like. Let the Canons of the Apoſtles; The Councels of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of <hi>Nice;</hi> The ſeveral diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the <hi>Decretum,</hi> &amp;c. be looked into. And there are divers Powers alſo neceſſarily belonging to theſe divers Orders of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, according to the diverſe Nature and Quality of the Affairs proper to their Offices. In the Old Teſtament there are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned High-prieſts, Prieſts of the ſecond Order (2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 23.4.) or Prieſts ſimply taken, Levites, and others. In the New, Apoſtles, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, Biſhops, Presbiters, or Prieſts, Deacons, and others. In
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59463:82"/> the Old Teſtament theſe Church Officers were perpetually fix'd to their ſeveral particular Imployments. And although in thoſe dayes the Old Teſtament Church-Polity was intended only for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Lawes both of the Church and State were ſuited one to another, and fixed thus for ever by God himſelf; yet it was left to Humane Prudence to vary ſtill in Circumſtances and indifferent things concerning the Eccleſiaſtical Polity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the preſent ſtate of Affairs might at any time require, the ſubſtance of that Polity ever remaining. So in <hi>Moſes, Joſhua</hi>'s, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s, <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s, and others times: And ſo there was a neceſſity, from the viciſſitudes of Affairs, that God had appointed to be in that Church, as well as in the reſt of the World, that it ſhould be. In the New Teſtament, the ſtanding ordinary Church-officers were appointed to be perpetual alſo. The Ordinary were thoſe whoſe Offices were ordinarily neceſſary for the well being of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church; the extraordinary thoſe who were appointed <hi>pro Tempore,</hi> and as the preſent ſtate of affairs in the firſt times did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And that the Platform of the perpetual and ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Biſhops, Preiſts, and Deacons, was derived and taken from the Pattern of High-prieſts, Preiſts, and Levites in the Old Teſtament, it will not at all be doubted by him that conſiders the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending thoſe things, and the Parity betwixt them. And laſt of all; if the <hi>Jewes</hi> Church, which was ſettled under one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Government, and confin'd to one only Nation, had Power to vary however according to the occaſions of times, in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and things indifferent, concerning their ordinary Church-Officers of Eccleſiaſtical Polity; then much more for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, hath the Chriſtian Church ſuch power to vary, which is laid open to be ſet up in all Nations, and appointed to conſiſt, as to theſe Circumſtances and things Indifferent, with the ſeveral ſorts of the Civil Policies of thoſe Nations and Countries.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Properly. And as to that it hath been a general compact of man-kind ever to treat with the Soveraine Princes of Countries about the ſtate of their Religion. So in the Convocating of the Divines of the ſeveral Countries to the Oecumenical Councels, in the Europian Parts of Chriſtendom, yea even in the times and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the greateſt Papal uſurpation; and the like.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Improperly. And as to that let us view the Lawes, and practiſes of Countries within themſelves, and in their ſeparate Capacities in reſpect to others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is to this purpoſe, and for the retaining with more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity the inveſtiture of this Power in Princes, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects, that the ſame perſon hath been ſo frequently both King and Prieſt in ſo many Ages, and Societies in the World. Let us look firſt amongſt the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> I have reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted formerly the Tradition amongſt them, of the firſt heads of Families, their being both Kings and Preiſts to thoſe that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them. And afterwards when they grew into a ſettled com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity under <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> their firſt Captain that brought them out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> was both King and Prieſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.6. And ſo alſo it was uſual with them afterwards, for the ſame perſon to be both High-prieſt and chief Magiſtrate. And here is again another Error and non-concluding argument of <hi>Grotius</hi> concerning theſe things; affirming that,<note place="margin">De Imper. cap. <hi>2. §. 5.</hi>
                  </note> after <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, the Coaleſcence of the cheif Preiſt-hood and Supreme Magiſtracy in one Perſon in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was forbidden by a Poſitive Law of God: And that becauſe the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59463:85"/> was reſtrained only to the Sons of <hi>Aaron;</hi> and ſo a ſtranger might not come nigh it. But what of that? although a ſtranger might not aſſume the Prieſthood, yet doth this argue, that a Prieſt might not aſſume the chief Magiſtracy? ſurely no. And therefore the inſtance of <hi>Ozias</hi> his being prohibited to meddle with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters proper to the Prieſtly Function given by him, is not pertinent.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Skickardus,</hi> nor others, who write of the things which did incapacitate any man from being King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> mention any ſuch thing as the Prieſthood amongſt them. And if the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Heathen Hiſtorie may be any thing in this buſineſs, then, <hi>Poſt Moſen etiam filius ejus Arvas, Sacerdos Sacris Aegyptiis,</hi>

It hath lay'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Laws, and Reſtrictions upon that Office, and the Juriſdictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it within their Territories, to this purpoſe, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Pope's thundering againſt them, as is to be ſeen in the Reaſons of their ſo doing ſet forth by the Impartial hand of Father <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of the Inquiſition,</hi>

And the further inſtances of theſe things are to be ſeen in the Collections of Records made concerning them by the Royal hand of the late wiſe King <hi>James</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The very Inquiſition of <hi>Spain</hi> holds the like courſe: It hath its own Lawes and proper Cuſtomes by which it is Govern'd;<note place="margin">See King <hi>James</hi> his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Right of Kings. <hi>Paſſim.</hi> See, the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. and <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Ibid.</hi> In the Preface.</note> Neither is it altered, or receiveth new Orders from <hi>Rome;</hi> and there is an account given of all things treated of within the State to the King; and advice ſent no whither elſe; and the King alwayes nameth an Inquiſitor General throughout all his Kingdomes, to have inſpection over that office, to the Pope: and his Holineſs doth confirm him; and he being confirm'd nameth the particular inquiſitors in every place, which nevertheleſs cannot enter into their Charge, without the Kings Approbation. Thus then both the <hi>moſt Chriſtian,</hi> and the <hi>moſt Catholick</hi> King; and be they who they will, and let the Pope call them by what names he will, and be they in never ſo ſtrict a League and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with, and profeſſed ſubjection to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet ſtill I ſay thus all of them deal in reſpect to this indirect power in Spirituals. As hath been already ſaid, The ſhadow of it may be conniv'd at in another, but the reality and ſubſtance of it hath been of neceſſity alwayes retained in the Princes themſelves.

                  </note> what is done within their Office: And we muſt conclude, that if it were not ſo, neither that part of <hi>his Holineſs</hi> his Perſon, which is the Temporal Prince; nor that part of it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the Roman Pontifex, could be able long in either of their Capacities to ſupport it ſelf againſt it's own inquiſitors. And
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59463:88"/> it is no wonder then that other Temporal Princes, whoſe Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are diſtinct from thoſe of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>the Lands of the Church,</hi> have not admitted of the Inquiſition generally; but by compact in the Original and firſt admiſſion of it.

Why the Eccleſiaſtical Perſon; for the Churches ſake committed more particularly and immediatly to him; ſhould not have Supremacy over all, and the contrary indirect power in Temporals as a Branch of it, and ſo conſequently belonging to him, as well as the Temporal Magiſtrate the like Supremacy, and this conſequent indirect power in Spirituals,</hi> which we have mentioned? will be, after theſe previous conſiderations laid down, the more plauſibly and eaſily anſwer'd by us. In the interim, this Supreme Juriſdiction over all in Church-men is the thing driven at by the Doctrines of two ſorts of Perſons in the Chriſtian Church, <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Chair and Conclave of <hi>Rome;</hi> and aſpiring Conſiſtories and Synods of Presbytery, as they are ſtated and deſired by ſome: And by both theſe, if not profeſſedly, yet at leaſt in the iſſue and effect of things, as hath been ſaid already. But we come to give only three weighty reaſons for the Civil Magiſtrates Supremacy. And thoſe are: 1. Becauſe the natural intent of the Civil Magiſtrates office imports it; Which primarily is the conſervation of Humane Society (ſpecifically taken, and as contradiſtinct to Church Society) and the governing men in their primary capacity of men. But Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society is the foundation of all Church Society; and without which that Church Society cannot ſubſiſt. And the Eccleſiaſtical Perſon governs men only in their ſecondary and additional Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Church-members, or Chriſtians, where the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is profeſſed. And therefore the Supremacy, from the nature of things, inevitably and neceſſarily belongs to him, who governs men in their Supreme and firſt Capacity.<note place="margin">Contra par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. lib. <hi>3.</hi>

And then, the corruptions of men being conſidered; and the Mundane Honours and intereſts which belongs to the Office of the Magiſtrate (as was mentioned above)
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59463:89"/> being propos'd as a Temptation to the Eccleſiaſtical Perſon;<note place="margin">

King James</hi> objects to him; that at the firſt he was but the poor pariſh Prieſt of his Church in <hi>Rome;</hi> but that now he was grown to a Supremacy over Kings, an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Paſtorſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is alſo farther to be obſerved concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him; that although he poſſeſſeth all the ſplendors belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the office of the Civil Magiſtrate, (He diſpenſeth the great Offices of State; he is ſerv'd in a more magnificent manner then moſt Temporal Princes in the World,) yet ſcarce any ſuch thing as the Supreme Civil Magiſtrates Office is own'd to be ſuſtained by his Perſon; but all is abſurdly, and againſt the nature of things, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out as belonging to him one way or other at leaſt, principally as St. <hi>Peters</hi> Succeſſor. But now on the contrary; if the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hold the Supremacy, there is no ſuch danger of the like perpetual injury, and of his uſurping, or extinguiſhing the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtcal Perſons Office: There being no ſuch worldly ſplendors belonging to it, neither ſuperiour nor equal to thoſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraties own Office, to be a temptation to him to uſurpe it. So then, this diſtinct order of Perſons and Power, which hath been mention'd, and which is appointed by God and Nature, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept up in the World, and particularly in the Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Churches, there will follow no ſuch confuſion of things, nor deſtruction of the right and natural order of them, appointed for the governing of the World, and the welfare of mankind in all Ages, as hath been mention'd; but if the contrary diſorder be attempted, the contrary confuſions and abſurdity in things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly will neceſſarily follow.<note place="margin">By the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Power in Spirituals, he is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-father to the Church. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 49.23. <hi>Prov</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.31.

               </p>
               <p n="22">XXII. In the interim, by this the Magiſtrates indirect Power in Spirituals, which I have here all along mentioned, he is appointed by God to be a <hi>Nurſing Father</hi> to the Church: Which he ſhould never forget to be; conſidering that it is by God <hi>that Kings Raign, and by him that Princes diſtribute Juſtice:</hi> He ſhould <hi>kiſs the Son, leaſt he be angry;</hi> or elſe he, that hath broken in pieces the Head of Gold, the Braſſe, and the Iron, and put a period to the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs in the World, can alſo in a moment put a period to any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Princes power whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. Laſt of all; the Supreme Magiſtrate in any Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity may commit the exerciſe of this his Indirect power in Spirituals to the Governours of the Church under him: And there is a neceſſity of his acting by others in this kind, as well as in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59463:90"/> any other; becauſe himſelf is not able to bear the whole burthen alone. And the more directly things tend towards the nature of purely ſpirituals; and the more neerly by conſequence that they concerne the Church; the more fit it is, that, where the Church is Incorporate into the State, they ſhould be put into the hands of Church-men to manage; the reſpects only, which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,<note place="margin">Hic Supra. §. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> being kept up to humane Society in the mean time. So then, to Church-men principally they ſhould be committed in Ordinary: The power of inſpection over the Church-men being only reſerved to the Prince himſelf, and the Liberty of Appeals to him from them, in any caſe happening, being granted to the Subject.

               <p>And this variety of Opinions amongſt men will not at all be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, if we look but to that infinite variety which is in Nature in all things whatſoever. And, as in all other things, ſo in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ordinary cauſes of men's forming their Opinions. And thoſe Natural and Ordinary cauſes become neceſſary alſo, <hi>Poſitis debitis circumſtantiis,</hi> and the circumſtances attending mens ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes being weighed as belonging to them. Such natural cauſes of mens varieties of Opinions in matters of Religion, and thoſe ſo neceſſary, as is ſaid, (and where there is otherwiſe no ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of God) are a thouſand things in the World. Their Maſters, their Books, their Companies, their Intereſts, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, their Educations, their varieties of Tempers and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, their degrees of light and underſtanding, and other the like things in all the infinite particulars of them; and all of them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating diverſly in men. The experience of all Ages will juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie theſe things: and particularly the Hiſtories and Monuments of the Chriſtian Church have been a large Comment upon the Truth of them. How many diverſities of Judgments have there been? and all of them accounted Hereſies by the mutually conteſting parties in matters of the Chriſtian Religion: In the Hiſtories of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and others; in the Catalogues of <hi>Epiphanius, Philaſtrius,</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> and the like Writings, it is to be ſeen.

So that we need look no further for the illuſtrating of this ſecond conſideration, then from theſe cauſes mentioned to their effects, and from the effects back again to their Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="7">VII.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59463:93"/> Cauſes of all miſchiefs in Humane Affairs, or elſe with the more particular Cauſes of Religious Conteſts:<note place="margin">Hic Supra. §. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> And both theſe, ſuch as were mention'd by us juſt now; and ſo ſome come forth accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with their corruptions, cunning, ſelf-ends, and worldly deſignes; Others with their infirmities, weakneſſes, and indiſcretions: the one ſort of them being weak in Judgment, and fit to be led, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing neither of times, nor perſons, nor things; neither conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from whence things proceed, nor whither they tend; and the other ſort leading them (if they do not run faſt enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) to the accompliſhing their ſeveral deſignes of Envie, Anger, Hatred, Malice, Ambition, Avarice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> although in the interim, as to the publick, it be even to the ruine of all Humane Society. And in the like manner are theſe conteſtors of opinions accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied alſo with the particular cauſes of ſuch their conteſting them; Thoſe ordinary ones which have been mentioned, and the like others, and ſo ſome come forth accompanied with their hot fiery vehemence of miſtaken Zeal, proceeding from the potent influence of the unduly fixed and immortal notion of Religion on their minds, and having an appetite to burn up all like ſtubble as it were that comes in their way: Others with the mixture of their private Paſſions, together with their indiſcretion and furious Zeal: Others with the mixture alſo of their adored worldly intereſts, together with all theſe things. And although perhaps the weaker ſorts of theſe conteſtors diſcerne not, even in themſelves, the private and ſubtile mixtures of theſe baſer things in the mean time; yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the effects of them are never the leſs direful to humane affairs. And now the great varieties and numbers of the mutual Thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of mens Opinions, which uſe to be in the World, being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in conjunction with theſe things; if all theſe things thus in conjunction one with another, be not enough to bring any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity under Heaven to the diſtempers and ruins which we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, if the ſwing of them be permitted; Then <hi>Sphinx aliud fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,</hi> Let any man aſſigne, if he can, any more certain and effectual cauſes of thoſe Diſtempers and Ruins, even in the Civil part of Humane Affairs, and where the potent influence of Religion (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) is not in Conjunction with them. And if there be an open looſe toleration of theſe things, where can they or will they ſtop, but at the Sword, which is the fatal and laſt way of determining all Controverſies amongſt men. And if any toleration whatſoever proceed but ſo farre as to the predominating of theſe things, then 'twill be found experimented too late, That the Tumultuous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and intereſts of men, when in ſuch a Poſture, are not to be ruled; and then either one party muſt prevail and be uppermoſt, and oppreſs all the reſt, and reduce them to a conformity to ſuch Lawes to be held over their opinions, as they ſhall think fit, and then the looſe Toleration is at an end; or elſe all muſt perſiſt to

And theſe things are evident from all times and Hiſtories in the World: Let the Church affairs of the <hi>Jewes, Gentiles, Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> be looked into. Finally, it is no wonder if it be ſo, ſince all matters, both of belief and practice in any Religion, whatſoever, which lead to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation of men in another world, come under one of theſe Notions, either of Doctrine or Worſhip, as is ſaid.

But becauſe writing is, and alwayes hath been the more ordinary way of the Conſervation of Things and Records amongſt men; and therefore the written ſort of theſe Doctrines are more ordinarily found in all Churches and Humane Societies; for this reaſon it is, that we here intend the Peace and Charity mention'd to be held principally concerning them. Worſhip alſo is either Publick or Private: And becauſe men are ſuppos'd to be reſerved and more ſeparate in their private Divine Worſhip (or elſe ſuch Worſhip will not bear the Notion of Private) Therefore it is that ſuch mutual Peace and Charity is here intended to be held concerning the Publick Divine Worſhip alſo; and that whether more or leſs principally, according as it is more or leſs Publick, and may from the more or leſs common uſe of it be ſo ſtiled.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The anſwer is Affirmatively, that they may be ſo: And the world is full of Preſidents in the caſe, according to the divers reſpects of ſeveral things to it, and the diverſities of the occaſions and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Societies. But then this inconvenience will follow, that under thoſe diverſities of communions held as to ſome of thoſe things, the people lie more open and ready, either to fall into any ſort of fractions (dangerous to the Publick) of themſelves, or elſe to be led away by others: Which thing, if the preſent occaſions of Societies will permit, would be avoyded by all Governours. And generally the means us'd to as much Unity as may be, and as the Conſiſtency of Government with Religion, and the common condition of other Humane Affairs will permit in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is beſt and moſt healthful for all Societies. Upon this account it is, That the voluntary Reductions of Societies, and when they have made them purely by choice and good deliberation, have been alwayes generally this way.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The proof of the ſecond Propoſition alſo.</note>XV. Our ſecond Propoſition then comes next to be prov'd, in relation to the removal of Religious Conteſts, and the procuring negative Charity, and that improper ſort of Peace (at leaſt) which followes upon it. And that briefly; for that there muſt of neceſſity be a reſtraint held upon mens venting and Diſſeminating of their Opinions, in relation to the effecting theſe things; it is ſufficiently evident from hence; becauſe there is no middle thing betwixt this holding ſome kind of reſtraint, or other, upon mens venting their opinions,<note place="margin">Supra lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cop. <hi>6.</hi> §. <hi>2.</hi> &amp;c.</note> whereby theſe things may be effected, and the looſe and open toleration of ſuch the venting of them which we have mention'd, and whereby all thoſe miſchiefs which ſuch a reſtraint
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59463:98"/> aims at the preventing of, follow upon Humane Societies. So that, where there is a mixture of divers Profeſſions in any Society; either ſome ſuch reſtraint, fortified with Penal Sanctions, muſt keep men from breaking the Peace by ſuch their Opinion-Conteſts, or elſe there is nothing remaining beſides <hi>in totâ rerum Natura</hi> for the doing of it. And hence it is that all Lawes have ever taken their laſt ſanctuary at this reſtraint for the conciliating of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace in theſe matters. The Lawes concerning the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Silencing of <hi>Anthemius, Severus, Petrus,</hi> and others, may be look'd into in the <hi>Novels</hi> of <hi>Juſtinian.</hi>

And although it be true, that a bare toleration and forbearance of one another mutually, as to opinion-feuds, may perhaps poſſibly be forc'd upon men by their own neceſſities in any Society (at leaſt for ſometime, and while the ſence of their own miſeries brought upon themſelves by ſuch their Opinion-Conteſts at any time is working them to a better Diſpoſition of mind, and condition in reſpect to the Publick-weal) yet however that is ſeldome; and when it is, detracts not at all from theſe things; ſince ſuch a neceſſity, in ſuch a caſe, as in the place of a Magiſtrate, or chief Governour, and effectually cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth men both to hold ſuch a reſtraint over themſelves, and at laſt, from the ſence of their own Calamities, to yeild to have it held over them by others. The late confuſions in <hi>England,</hi> and their ſuggeſting evidently to the conteſting parties the neceſſity of their reception of their Rightful Soveraigne to govern them again, was a great inſtance of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="16">XVI. In the laſt place then,<note place="margin">The general Concluſion ſubjoyn'd to to all theſe things.</note> we have only one general Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſubjoyne here to all theſe things: And that is, that, if it be ſo that theſe are the only great and ſtated means which we have mentioned, for the thus procuring Charity and removal of Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then who ſhall deny the uſe of them to the Chief Governour in any Society for the effecting theſe things? ſhall it not be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nay, neceſſary for him, as his Duty, and as his Government is a Charge committed to him by God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. §. 11.</note> as well as upon the account of its being barely his right to hold it (as was above firſt of all diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd) to propoſe and enjoyn ſuch an Unity of Profeſſion and Uſe of Publick Worſhip, ſo farre forth as his affairs will permit; and that for the promotion of Chriſtian Charity in the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, or elſe of Common Charity amongſt men, if in a falſe Church of any other Religion? Or elſe however, to hold a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon the irregular venting of Opinions to the breach of the Peace? Who will deny it? We conclude then, that the faculty of doing theſe things, is a Fundamental, and a very principal part of the Magiſtrates Indirect Power in Spirituals; and a Right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him, in every Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, and in the

If we look into the New-Teſtament, the Chriſtian Church was not National for ſome Centuries of years after it's firſt founding by the Saviour of the World: And the condition of it was to be altogether different from that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> before.

We will go on further, to the Councel of <hi>Antioch.</hi> The firſt Canon of it is for the Uniforme Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter:</hi> And ſeveral of the following Canons were ſhap'd for the cutting off occaſions of <hi>Contentions in that Church.</hi> Let us go on to other the like Councels: We ſhall find, in ſeveral, Forms of Liturgies appointed to be approv'd of by thoſe Councels, and to be propos'd and enjoyn'd to the Churches. Let us go on to others: We ſhall find one forme of ſinging, of Praying, of uſing other Cuſtomes and Ceremonies, and that throughout all the Churches of one and the ſame Nation; and that alſo becauſe the Congregations and Churches contained in the Nation were all of the ſame National Religion. We ſhall find alſo thoſe of divers Profeſſions ordained to be prohibited, and the Feaſts and Rites of the Gentiles not to be tolerated, and many other the like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, in many particulars, tending all to the uniting men to one Profeſſion, and to the cutting off occaſions of conteſts in matters of Religion, as might be more particularly mention'd. And thus then the Chriſtian Church, as it grew in Age and Settlement in divers places, grew on alſo to further degrees of Uniformity. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as it hath been of Old, ſo of late: All Pacificators would have ſome kind of Uniformity or other. The <hi>Scotch</hi> Miniſters themſelves, in their Advice (mention'd) to <hi>Arch Biſhop Spotſwood</hi> for the procuring Peace in the Church, would have an Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Thus then hath this Uniformity been the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               <p n="13">XIII. Let us come alſo to the Civil Lawes and Conſtitutions of Countries in the ſame matter. And we will begin firſt with thoſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their unparalell'd Theocracy. And God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in it his ſeveral forms both of Doctrine and Worſhip, as hath been mention'd.

And they had alſo their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Eccleſiaſtical Conventions, and Synods, for the determination of emergent Controverſies concerning theſe things, and the chief Magiſtrate making uſe of them to that End: and many more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars might be mention'd. After <hi>Iſrael</hi> follow the Civil and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Lawes and Conſtitutions of all Nations in like manner, and ſo far forth as there are Records left concerning them. In the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchies, amongſt the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and divers other Nations, we find the mention of their <hi>Country Gods,</hi> peculiar to them ſeverally; and of their Forms of Doctrines, and ſet Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Sacrifices, and cuſtomary Rites and Ceremonies appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to them alſo: And no wonder, ſince the dictates of the common Humane Nature alwayes ſuggeſted to them theſe things, for the ſetling of their Religion in a National way.

Let us look to the next Title, we ſhall ſtill find the like things. Let us look on; and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanies</hi> are prohibited to be made by Lay-men; the Church Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and Canonical Sanctions are appointed to be obſerved, and that to no leſs degree then the Imperial Civil Laws. Finally, it would be infinite to recite all the Particulars that are diſpers'd up and down in the <hi>Code,</hi> to theſe and the like purpoſes and intents. He that will may view them. Let us proceed from it to the <hi>Novels;</hi> And there are ſtill the like, and almoſt the like number of Lawes. In the 38 Conſtitution the <hi>Arrians</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> are confiſcated, and their goods given to the Churches. An Heretick is prohibited to Baptize, or to bear any Office in the Common-weal, or to have any Houſe of Prayer. In the 42 Conſtitution <hi>Neſtorius, Eutyches, Arrius, Macedonius, Eunomius,</hi> and others, are depoſed. And the offence of <hi>Anthinus</hi> againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Canons is made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of. And afterwards he is baniſh'd from the imperial City or any other Great City, that there might be Peace amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and he might not ſpread his interdicted Opinions, and the like. If we go on, in the 109 Conſtitution, all are ſtiled Heriticks who are not of the Imperial Catholick and Apoſtolick Church. If we go on ſtill, the four Councels (but now mentioned) are again appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be recieved. And if we go on further; it is argued, that if the Civil Lawes, which reſpect mens outward Security, are to be obſerv'd; then how much more the Eccleſiaſtical Canons which reſpect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e health of their Souls? and afterwards, the Peoples not having learnt their Liturgies is taxed: and the like. Finally, many more the like Lawes might be recited. Let us paſs then from theſe Volumes of Lawes, to the Code of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> And that proceeds alſo in the like manner in theſe things. Let the Titles, <hi>De his qui ſuper Religione contendunt; De Haereticis;</hi> in the 16 Book; and the like in other Books of it be conſulted. Let us go on from it to the Body of the Canon Law. In the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Decretum;</hi> in the <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, Clementines,</hi> and <hi>Extravagants,</hi> up and down, no man will doubt, but that the Roman Uniformity, and the Cuſtomes and Lawes of that Church are enjoyn'd. It would be too needleſly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to make a particular recital of theſe matters. Laſt of all, the like alſo are the preſent Lawes of the other Chriſtian Churches abroad in the world. The Canon Law is taught in their Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and many of it's Decrees and Conſtitutions, tending to theſe things which we have mention'd,<note place="margin">See the Laws and Statutes in quarto <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>Ibid. vid.</hi>
                  </note> are made uſe of for the regiment of thoſe Churches. The very <hi>Statutes of Geneva</hi> will have no ſtrange or falſe Opinions, againſt the Doctrine received, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59463:104"/> will not allow of Negligence in coming to Church, to the contempt of the Communion of the Faithful,<note place="margin">See the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Kirk, <hi>Edit Anno</hi> 1641. <hi>&amp; alibi.</hi> See in his Life By <hi>J. H. p.</hi> 188. <hi>Lond.</hi> 63.</note> and the like. And the like Church orders are to be found in the <hi>Corpus Diſciplinae,</hi> and amongſt the Low Country Churches, in the Diſcipline of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and amongſt its preſcriptions. And finally, in the very humble Petition and advice preſented in the late times of uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> when he was coming towards his deſired ſitting down in the Throne: In which was propoſed a Confeſſion of Faith to be aſſented to (in matters of Religion) and to be recommended to the People. And thus then all theſe things will ſufficiently evidence, how all mankind hath conſpired Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally in it's Laws and Conſtitutions in Societies, towards this Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Uniformity, and for thoſe intents and ends which we have mention'd.</p>

In the laſt Place then, this one thing is further obſervable, that, whereſoever this Uniformity hath been, either but in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and improper part of it, or elſe but in ſome ſmall meaſures of the Poſitive; there ſtill, according as Controverſies in Religion dangerous to the Publick have ariſen, Princes have been forc'd to come to further degrees of it.

And if the pretence of it be intended to amuſe the vulgar, that is not Honeſt. But briefly, ſince the Divine Law of Chriſt hath not appointed it to any man to preſcribe Religious precepts, neither Originally, nor by Interpretation, we muſt conclude, that it is not ſo convenient for Humane Societies, that there ſhould be ſuch an infallible interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſhip conſtituted and eſtabliſhed in them.</p>

And that is, from it's affording to all their Rights, <hi>(viz.)</hi> thoſe which have been heretofore mentioned, either more generally or more particularly: To God his Right, in it's croſſing none of his commands, but aſſiſting to the performance of them: To the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate his Right; in it's being proportioned to his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and the diſcharge of his Truſt: To the Church Governours alſo, in their way, their Rights; by it's affording to them the like meanes of the diſcharge of their Functions in their ſeveral places and capacities: To the private Chriſtian his Right; by it's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to him the enjoyment of his Chriſtian Liberty, and the uſe of his liberty of Conſcience and Judgement of diſcerning: To the Subject alſo his Rights by it's enjoyning nothing upon him but by lawful Legiſlative Authority: And laſt of all, to all theſe their Rights, both mixtly and in their ſeveral reſpects, by it's cutting off occaſions of Contentions, and of corrupt wicked mens abuſing and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59463:107"/> invading theſe Things and Perſons ſeverally, to the diſorder and deſtruction of Humane Societies, and the welfare of them. And this is the Golden mean in ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity. And theſe are the more general Rules of diſtributive Juſtice, which are to be obſerv'd by all Princes and Governours in their due fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

And the greater neceſſity of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, and of this work, dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from it.</note>I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Preſcript of the Chriſtian Religion is the beſt of any that ever hath been in the World, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Doctrines, and explicatory of the particular Precepts of the Law of Nature; and conſequently, the moſt perfectly directive of men in their way to Heaven, and as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Humane Society. And yet (through the weakneſſes and corruptions of men) there hath none been the ſubject of more contentions: Men having wire-drawn the doctrinal Texts of it, and every Sect and Hereſie having ſuted them to their own turns, and all having applyed that and the like Texts of the Apoſtle to their times, and in reſpect to their Opinions, and the oppoſers of them, that there muſt alſo be hereſies amongſt you,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you: Which things ſhew the greater neceſſity of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity in the Chriſtian Church, and of this work, for the explicating and unfolding of it, and the rights belonging to it. I come then here in this third and laſt Book to treat more particularly of that Uniformity, and that in a ſpecial manner of the two grand inſtruments of it, <hi>(viz.)</hi> a Canon of Doctrines, and a Liturgy framed according to it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">A Canon of Doctrines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</note>II. And, firſt of all, that which is meant here by a Canon of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, is, a Rule or Standard of Doctrines, exhibited and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for profeſſion of aſſent to be made to, in any Church. And ſuch a Canon is either written, or elſe unwritten and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. And the written is either Syſtematical, and collected unto one body of Doctrines,<note place="margin">The ſtate of the caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its being the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and principal of the two grand inſtruments in an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. §. 4.</note> or elſe diffuſed and diſperſed amongſt other things. And either of theſe may be either Humane or Divine: The Humane is that which is exhibited and propounded as ſuch by Humane Authority; the Divine, by Divine Authority.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This Canon of Doctrine is the primary and principal of theſe two grand Inſtruments of an Uniformity. And, in our ſtating of it ſo, we mean it alſo principally and ordinarily of a written, Syſtematical, and Humane Canon, and not of the contrary. And
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59463:109"/> that becauſe the traditional ſort of Doctrines are leſs ordinarily found in Churches, as hath been heretofore mentioned; and alſo becauſe the Syſtematical Humane Canon, is the only Natural way for the procuring poſitive Peace and Charity in matters conteſted, as hath been hinted alſo, and ſhall hereafter be more expreſly aſſerted. It is true, that it were better that their ſerving one and the ſame God, or any the like fundamental ſingle Doctrine (if it might be) and although not with the allowance of ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to one another from him) were a foundation for a <hi>medium</hi> of charitative communion betwixt <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Jew</hi> inhabiting in the ſame Neighbour-hood of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or any the like part of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, then that all Peace and Charity in matters of Religion ſhould be utterly broken: But where there is a National Church, and where the Governour would procure any ſort of poſitive Charity, either Chriſtian or common, and any tolerable degree and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it amongſt his People, he muſt come to a more large and Syſtematical Canon of Doctrines.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. We come then to define alſo what we mean by a Liturgy,<note place="margin">A Liturgy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed alſo.</note> the ſecond of theſe main inſtruments in this Uniformity. And, by the uſe and cuſtomary application of the word, in this Caſe, That which is vulgarly meant by it alſo, is more generally, any publick form of Divine Service, and more ſpecially and particularly ſuch a publick form of Prayer to be uſed in Divine Service, and at the ſeveral occaſions of it. And ſo, that which preſcribes the matter only of the Publick Divine Service, is called a Directory; and that which preſcribes the Form alſo a Liturgy; and that which is bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the preſcription of neither, is purely an extemporary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p n="5">V. It is convenient,<note place="margin">It is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that where a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is uſed, there be as few other ſorts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Services permitted to accompany it as may be.</note> that where there is a ſtated Liturgy made uſe of in any Church, there be as few other ſorts of Services, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extemporary or directive permitted, as may be: And that not only becauſe thoſe other ſorts of Services accompanying it, ſhould not come into competition with the Authorized Liturgy, in the wild eſteem of the people; but alſo for many other Reaſons which might be mentioned. And this is to be conſtrued more principally of ſervices of the ſame kind, and leſs principally alſo of Services of divers kinds. The Church of <hi>England</hi> in this caſe, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented her ſelf, <hi>ad minimum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Canons Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical.</note> with the preſcription of a Directory in the particular of Publick Prayer before the Sermon, and with advice, that it ſhould be performed as briefly as conveniently may be. And the like have been the conſtitutions in other Churches.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The Liturgy alſo in any Church ought to be compoſed and framed according to the mind and tenour of the Canon of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. And that becauſe it is one Office of ſuch a Liturgy,<note place="margin">The Liturgy alſo ought to be conformed to the Canon of Doctrines.</note> in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, to exhibit to the people the doctrine taught in any National Church, and by its ſo doing to inſtruct them,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59463:110"/> from their ordinary uſe of it, in thoſe Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <note place="margin">The Heathen, Jewiſh and Apoſtolical Liturgies conteſted.</note>VII. Amongſt the ſeveral inſtruments of the Uniformities that have been heretofore in the world, the Liturgies of all the three firſt Celebrated profeſſions of Religion have been more eſpecially conteſted: And that the Heathen Liturgies in their circumſtantials, but the Jewiſh and Apoſtolical Liturgies of the Chriſtian Church, in the ſubſtance and very being of them. As to the Heathen Liturgies, it hath been alledged, that they ought not to be accounted of as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary to Chriſtians: But the allegation hath err'd, <hi>in ſenſu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito;</hi> for although it be true that they ought not to be accounted of as ſuch <hi>Quatenus</hi> Heathen Liturgies, yet it doth not follow, but that however, and the light of Nature upon the grounds heretofore mentioned warranting it, they ought to be accounted of as ſuch <hi>Quatenus</hi> Liturgies. But the Jewiſh and Apoſtolical Liturgies have born the principal brunt of the conteſt. As to the Jewiſh State, the occaſions of it were two-fold; either Eternal or Temporary. The Eternal were in relation to its defence againſt Heatheniſm, and the Nations of that Profeſſion round about it. The temporary in this caſe were in relation to Domeſtick Schiſmes, and the miſchiefs accruing to the publick from them. And the conſtitutions in it concerning both theſe, were either Divine or Humane. As to its Eternal occaſions, and the ſerving of them, I look upon the firſt Table of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as evidently directing to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Doctrines. And as to its temporary occaſions, and the ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, I look upon the Scriptural Temple-Service, and the like preſcript forms of Ceremonials in any of their times, as ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one part of the place of a Liturgy. And theſe were the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Divine Conſtitutions concerning theſe matters. But if it be enquired farther and more particularly, either what were the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Humane Conſtitutions, either concerning the temporary or eternal occaſions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> either as to its Temple or Synagogue Service; in moſt things it is very hard certainly to determine. That God approved of a form of Prayer as lawful in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is evident from the cuſtomary Prayer of <hi>Moſes (Num.</hi> 10.35, 36.) at the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forward and reſting of the Ark; and from many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which might be mentioned. And that there were forms of ſinging, and of other Services uſed, both in the Temple, and in the Synagogues, it is evident, both from the ordinary uſe of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, and of the Hymnes of <hi>Aſaph</hi> the Seer as ſuch (ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30.) and from the ſtated Sections and Lectures of the Law, noted in the Hebrew Text, and appointed to be read in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues by courſe upon every Sabbath throughout the year; and from other particulars alſo which might be mention'd. And but that there was a Liturgy, taken in a ſpecial ſence, in uſe alſo, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſome body of ſet forms of Prayer appropriated to both theſe ſorts
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59463:110"/> of ſervices, there is no reaſon in the world to doubt of it. But that God ſhould compoſe and conſtitute ſuch a Liturgy at the firſt founding of the other Laws of that Society, and with injunction of it upon future Ages, it could not rationally be expected, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of occaſions of that Society being conſidered, and which ſuch a Liturgy was temporarily to be ſtinted to. And however, becauſe ſuch his compoſing and conſtituting of it, or any part of it, is not mentioned in Scripture, nor in any other Humane Records of that Church that are extant, and perhaps of ſuch certainty as may be required, it is no Argument at all, that therefore there was never ſuch a one, or ſo conſtituted. That there ſhould be Synagogues in all the particular Pariſhes, and leſſer Diviſions in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who will doubt but that it was approved of by God: But yet we find no mention o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> them in Scripture, and as conſtituted by any Divine Law: What wonder then if not of the Liturgies to be uſed in them? The ſum of all is, That the Records of that Church, both Humane and Divine, are in part at leaſt loſt and defective: The Divine, although not as to fundamentals of Religion, yet as to many other things; and the providence of God is acknowledged, in the mean time, to be ſufficiently ſalv'd by the aſſertion: And the Humane almoſt totally, and in every part of them. And ſo then we muſt be content to acquieſce in Rabbinical traditions, and things of the like credit, and in that number of them that is to be found extant alſo. The like almoſt is the condition of the firſt Ages of the Chriſtian Church: There are but very few Records of its Affairs of thoſe times remaining. That the Apoſtles conſtituted Liturgies, there is reaſon to believe, although theirs were not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches, but yet not with injunction of them neither upon future Ages. That the Creed commonly called the Apoſtles, was framed for general aſſent, and profeſſion of aſſent alſo to be made to it, we have it from the general fame and tradition of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches. And that a form of Prayer was approved of, it is evident from the uſe of ſuch by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in his Agony,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.44. Luke 11.2.</note> and from his teaching his own Prayer to his Apoſtles as a form; and concerning ſome of the petitions of which, ſome Criticks ſay, and not improbably, that he deriv'd them from ſome publick forms then extant amongſt the Jews: And divers other things might be mentioned. But ſtill, and all theſe things being conſidered, we do not ſee any reaſon at all for any abſolute denyal of the being of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, either in the Jewiſh or Apoſtolical Chriſtian Churches.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. In the interim,<note place="margin">The preſent Liturgies that are abroad in the world.</note> we come to the aſſignation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Liturgies that are abroad in the World. And as the Canons of Doctrines every where are actually conceded; ſo they are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be conceded, ſince there is no being for any ſuch thing as Religion in any Church without ſome one ſort of Canon, or other of thoſe that have been mentioned neceſſarily co-exiſtent with it;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59463:111"/> and ſince there is no being for any poſitive peace and charity in matters of Religion ordinarily, without ſuch a Syſtematical Canon, as hath been mentioned alſo; and that alſo eſtabliſhed either tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or expreſly by the Authority of the Superiour. Liturgy then (taken either in a general or ſpecial ſenſe) is diſpers'd at preſent over the whole face of the Earth. Amongſt the <hi>Gentues</hi> or <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> the Eaſtern Hiſtories relate its being made uſe of every where. Amongſt the Jews alſo it is uſed in like manner, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Editions of their Publick Prayers in Hebrew, Printed by themſelves both at <hi>Venice</hi> and in <hi>Polonia;</hi> and as is recorded by <hi>Manaſſe Ben Iſrael,</hi>

And laſtly, and in a more ſpecial manner, the like is in uſe every where in the Chriſtian Churches. We will begin with the <hi>Abaſſines,</hi> or <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Chriſtians: And their confeſſion of Faith, and forms of Prayer, and of other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervices, are recited by <hi>Danianus a Goes, Godignus,</hi> and others. Let us go on from them to the Churches in <hi>Aſia;</hi> and as to them, the forms of Doctrines and Liturgies of the <hi>Syrians, Georgians, Armenians, Neſtorians, Jacobites,</hi> and others, are recited by <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus,</hi> in his <hi>Oration after his Return out of Auſtria;</hi> and by the ſeveral Authors mentioned by Mr. <hi>Brerewood,</hi> to that purpoſe, and others. Let us proceed from them to the other part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, lately extant in the <hi>Weſt Indies:</hi> And we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them to be conformed to the <hi>Roman</hi> or other Profeſſions who have ſubjected them to them. And laſt of all, let us come into <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularize theſe matters of the Chriſtian Churches there: And firſt, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and the Dominions and Territories of Princes holding communion with it; and ſo far forth as their affairs ſeverally will permit,<note place="margin">In his enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts &amp; ſects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of the ſeveral Languages wherein the Liturgies, <hi>&amp;c paſſim.</hi>
                  </note> we need not doubt of the exiſtence of ſuitable forms of Doctrines, and Liturgies framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them.

Next to that follows the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to be conſidered; That is to ſay, the Chriſtian Churches now remaining in <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Territories of that Communion adjacent and belonging to it: And we are aſſured of their <hi>Horologies, Liturgies, Letanies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Oratione poſt reditum ex Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriâ, &amp;c. in princip.</note>

Next to them let us paſs on to the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Church, it holding communion for the moſt part with them: And their Doctrines, and Liturgical forms are deſcribed alſo by <hi>Fletcher,</hi>

                  <hi>I have tryed it, and after much ſearch and many diſputes, have concluded it to be the beſt in the world, not only in the community as Chriſtian, but alſo in the ſpecial Notion, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, keeping the middle way between the pomp of ſuperſtitious Tyranny, and the meanneſs of phantaſtick Anarchy.</hi> And many the like Teſtimonies in this matter of meaner perſons might be added.

In her dayes firſt began the Domeſtick oppoſitions of ſome of thoſe of the Reformed Profeſſion to be made againſt it: And they quickly were made Popular; and the Effects of them are felt to this very day.

And all theſe things being thus on foot, the ordinary cauſes of ſuch Religious conteſts, (heretofore in this Diſcourſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) muſt needs be ſuppoſed to work together with them on both ſides, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Vulgars miſtakes in Religion, the colliſion of paſſions (like Flints ſtriking fire out of one another) the mixture of worldly intereſts, and the like; and the weakneſſes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of men were the oyl to all theſe flames. Till the dayes of <hi>King James,</hi> then theſe oppoſitions ſtill grew on.

And in the King's time, they were further told, That <hi>Omnis mutatio periculoſa, &amp; plena ſcandalis:</hi> That, <hi>the leaſt change, as things ſtood, was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,

                  </note> And the King himſelf had a conference with ſome of the heads of them at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> And certainly it will always hold true, That, things ſetled by the deep and deliberate conſiderations of former times, although the bottom Reaſons of them may not preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all, are not to be eaſily altered. Laſt of all, in the time of <hi>King Charles the Firſt,</hi> the opponents were ſtill further told in Parliament, that their Diſcipline would not conſiſt with Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; That Epiſcopacy, being at leaſt lawful,<note place="margin">See the Lord <hi>Digbies</hi> ſpeech in the houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641.</note> there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for its being aboliſhed, and the like.

And it is pitty, that a Church ſo well and temperately ſetled ſhould be diſturb'd. The like to this of the Uniformity in the general hath been the more particular Hiſtory of the Canon of Doctrines alſo and Liturgy, both as to the original and traduction of them. The Canon of Doctrine, for the moſt part of it, was contrived and compoſed alſo in the time of <hi>King Edward the ſixth,</hi> and by the advice of his Divines, and at the ſpecial inſtances and inſtigation of the Holy and Reverend Arch-Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi>

By others afterwards in more things, and with greater ſeverity: Partly by a rigid Interpretation of Phraſes, partly by a flat contradiction of Doctrine.

Theſe things being thus more particularly ſaid, we come here again to expatiate into the general; and in the laſt place to ſubjoyn ſeveral <hi>Queſtione</hi> concerning the two grand Inſtruments of an Uniformity as ſuch: And the reſolution of which belongs, either more expreſly or implicitely, to the things already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning them.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:59463:113"/>XI. In the firſt place then, the firſt of them is,<note place="margin">The firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether a tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and more ceremonial, or elſe a written and more doctrinal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of Religion be in its ſelf least ſubject to popular conteſts?</hi> And as to it, it is anſwered affirmatively, concerning the former of theſe; That it is, in it ſelf, leaſt ſubject to be popularly conteſted. And the reaſons of it are, becauſe a <hi>Traditional</hi> Preſcript is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the peoples view, and ſo far forth as it is <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> but ſecondarily and mediately doctrinal. But then it is purely at the good pleaſure of God, whether he will conſtitute ſuch an one for his preſcript of the True Religion, or not, and when ſuch an one is conſtituted by men, it is but a double Artifice. And God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe the Light of the Goſpel, and the encreaſe of Knowledge under it, was to be diſplayed, hath conſtituted the Chriſtian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript almoſt totally <hi>Doctrinal:</hi> And, writings being the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way for the conſervation of things, he hath conſtituted his preſcript alſo perpetually written; And hath left it to Humane Prudence, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and according to the divers occaſions of Societies, to ſecure it from noxious vulgar conteſtations by the Laws of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The ſecond <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, whether <hi>the Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Second.</note> 
                  <hi>the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Divine Canon, be not ſufficient, and ſuch, as in its place, for the attaining the ends of an Eccleſiaſticol <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity?</hi> The anſwer is, No. And yet it detracts not at all from the Honour of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but only argues the weakneſs of men amongſt whom it hath its being. For the Chriſtian Scripture being large, and full of many and diſperſed, and diverſly cloathed aſſertions concerning the ſame things, it is evident that it wants a ſkilful and induſtrious explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Or elſe we will put the caſe in common concerning any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly <hi>Original Divino Canon,</hi> as well as it, conſtituted in any Society whatſoever. And ſtill it will hold, that when controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ariſe concerning it, a <hi>living Judge</hi> with his <hi>Humane ſyſtematical Canon,</hi> is the onely natural way for the ordinary compoſing of them.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. We come to the Third<note place="margin">The Third.</note> 
                  <hi>Queſtion;</hi> and that is, whether <hi>the ſame ſpecifical Ordinances only, and extemporary Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; or elſe however the performance of the the Publick Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in any National Church in the way of Directory, may not be, in ſome ſort, ſufficient for the preſervation of the Publick Peace in that Church?</hi> The anſwer is, Yes: But not ſo ſufficient as a Liturgy.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. §. 14.</note> For, as was ſaid above in the Queſtion of the like nature concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing varieties of Communions as to ſome things permitted in any Church; ſo here alſo it is to be ſaid, That either under a <hi>Directory,</hi> or <hi>extemporary Publick Services,</hi> the people will lye more open and ready either to fall into any ſort of Religious Factions of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe to be led into them by others. And, all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours being bound to uſe all lawful means for the procuring of as much Peace and Chriſtian Charity as may be amongſt their people;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59463:114"/> and a Liturgy being none of the extreams in an Eccleſiaſtical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, but in the vulgar tongue being in it ſelf lawful, there is no reaſon in the world, but that it ſhould take place where it may, and where the Publick Affairs will bear it, before either of the two other ſorts of Services.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The fourth<note place="margin">The Fourth.</note> appendant <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, whether <hi>a Liturgy do not tranſgreſs the Rules of Scripture Conſtitutions, in hindring and laying a reſtraint upon the uſe of Spiritual Gifts to be exerciſed in publick by the Miniſters, or Spiritual Conducts in the performance of Divine Service in any Chriſtian Church?</hi> The anſwer to it alſo is, No. And the ſtate of this caſe is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Supream Magiſtrate, in any Society, hath in the general the power over the uſe of the <hi>Gifts</hi> of all Spiritual Perſons in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: And it is one particular part of his <hi>Indirect Power in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals;</hi> and neceſſary alſo to the preſervation of the welfare of his Supream Publick Charge. Since it is evident, both in it ſelf, and from the experience of all Ages, that by the undue uſe of thoſe <hi>Gifts,</hi> if it be permitted, either Religion or Government, or the conſiſtency of Religion with Government, may be ruin'd in any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And upon theſe accounts it is, that this Power of reſtraint over the <hi>uſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> hath been ever claim'd, and made uſe of by all Princes accordingly: And he that ſhall deny it them, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the means to the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scriptural end of the uſe of all ſuch <hi>Gifts,</hi> is, for the publick good and edification of the Church: For ſo ſayes St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. <hi>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall</hi> (i. e.) <hi>ut Eccleſia fructum inde percipiat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Loc.</note> ſays <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſo others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Gifts</hi> here principally concern'd, and of which the uſe is to be made, are thoſe of <hi>Knowledge, Invention,</hi> and <hi>Elocution.</hi> And if theſe are made uſe of, either in <hi>Extemporary</hi> or <hi>Directorial</hi> Services; ſo are they made uſe of alſo in the uſe of a Liturgy. The <hi>Knowledge, Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Invention</hi> of thoſe that compoſed it, in the compoſure of it; and the <hi>Elocution</hi> of him that is imployed in the uſe of it, in that his actual uſing of it.</p>
               <p>The immediate effects of the uſe of theſe Miniſterial <hi>Gifts</hi> in a Chriſtian Church, are either ordinary and natural, or elſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ſupernatural. The ordinary are the generating of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral knowledge and affections in others; the extraordinary, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite. And if the generating theſe extraordinary effects of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> may be expected to accompany the uſe of either of the two ſorts of the mentioned ſervices: ſo alſo it may be expected to accompany the due uſe of a Liturgy, and that at leaſt in an equal manner, for ought appears either from the Divine or Natural Law, either from any general or particular precepts of them, or any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God annexed to them; eſpecially it being conſidered, how
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59463:114"/> much the uſe of a Liturgy tends to the excluding of Schiſms and Hereſies, and to the generating of Chriſtian Unity, and Charity, and Peace, (which are the conſequential effects of ſuch an uſe of it) more at leaſt then the uſe either of a <hi>Directory,</hi> or <hi>Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Service</hi> doth.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, the concluſion in this matter then is evident from theſe poſitions and compariſons of things; That the uſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial <hi>Spiritual Gifts</hi> in the way of a Liturgy (all things being conſidered which belong to the Caſe) may be expected to be of more benefit to any Church, and the Community in it, then the uſe of thoſe gifts in the other wayes mentioned. The complaints then in this matter are unjuſt, That by the uſe of a Liturgy in a Church, men are abridg'd of their Chriſtian Liberty (a part of which the uſe of mens gifts in Publick is not; but it is one ſort of outward actions.) And ſo alſo, that the free uſe of their gifts is reſtrained, and the like. It is true, variety and novelty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light Humane Nature: And, the more remote from Forms, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Services in Religion are, the more, upon thoſe accounts, they are apt to take the vulgar, and to ſeem, diverſly, to them as <hi>Lovely Songs,</hi> and the like: And therefore they are the fitter Inſtruments for any Hereſiark to make uſe of. But he that will either ſettle a Church in the capacity of a Governour, or elſe ſtate his Caſe of Conſcience aright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in this matter in the capacity of a private perſon, muſt conſider the conſequences of theſe things.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. The like to this alſo is the <hi>Queſtion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Fifth.</note> Whether <hi>a Liturgy may be uſed with ſo much attention of mind, and equal degrees of affection, as a Directorical, or Extemporary Service?</hi> But the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is not rightly put, to argue the ſimple unlawfulneſs of a Liturgy: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Which of theſe two ſorts of Services, either <hi>Liturgical,</hi> or <hi>Non-Liturgical</hi> may be attended at any time, with the greater degrees of theſe things, it is uncertaine, according to mens ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of endowment with thoſe ſpiritual gifts we mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſt now. If their invention of matter and elocution be ſo prompt, as that it doth not take up their minds more then either the reading or the ſaying of a Liturgy by heart (perhaps after a frequent and continued uſe of it) then a <hi>Non-Liturgical</hi> Service may exceed, otherwiſe not. And as to the phraſe of a Liturgy in this matter, and its being Spiritual: In ſome places it ought to attend comprehenſion of ſenſe, and Doctrinals, and Gravity and ſolemne weightineſſe of phraſe (to poiſe the mind in the uſe of it) as well as altogether that which is affectionate, or may be deemed Spiritual. So the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy doth; And ſo doth even the Scripture it ſelf. And laſt of all, if the imployment of the mind may be ſuppoſed to be <hi>more Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>within its
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59463:115"/> ſelf</hi> in the uſe of a <hi>Non-Liturgical,</hi> then of a <hi>Liturgical</hi> Service; it returns to this, That in a <hi>Non-Liturgical</hi> Service the invention, as it were, hunts out for ſome preſent either phraſe or matter, which the eye hath formerly read; and in a Liturgy the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion attends upon either the eyes preſent reading, or the heart and memories preſent dictating to it. And ſo, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage may be from hence, except on the Liturgies part, we do not ſee. It is true, men are apt not to be ſo mindful of their imploying their affections and attention of mind in the uſe of a Liturgy, as in Services, where the faculty of invention is neceſſarily put upon action: But then that is their own fault, and not the fault of the Liturgy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But we will ſuppoſe the Conceſſion of Liturgies not being, in the ſimple uſe of it, ſo capable of theſe things. And yet however this doth not conclude rightly for the either unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſo much as inconveniency of a Liturgy: Since all this, and a great deal more, will be abundantly recompenſed to any Church by its being in its ſelf ſuch a means of Unity and Peace, as hath been mentioned: So that thus then, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe exceptions to be made againſt it, it doth not follow, but that a Canon of Doctrines and Liturgy, and in that kind of them and manner, as they are here aſſerted by us, are the two grand inſtruments of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity: And that a Liturgy, <hi>Secundum debitum Rationis,</hi> and where affairs will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, is in its ſelf to be preferred before either a <hi>Directory,</hi> or <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Services.</hi> We come then but to two more <hi>Queſtions</hi> or <hi>Queries,</hi> ſecondarily concerning theſe things, and ſo we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter.</p>

And theſe things are to be heeded by all Princes, and Synods of Divines in this matter. And theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules are to be applyed to all particular Caſes. And although perhaps many times, eſpecially in times of preſent Factions in Societies, there may be diſcontents ariſing, and fomented, and cryes made of ſcandals and offences given by ſuch Princes proceedings, and the like, yet they ought not to heed thoſe things, ſo as to cauſe them at all to depart from theſe rules of diſtributive Juſtice in this affair.</p>
               <p n="17">XVII. In the laſt place then, the laſt <hi>Queſtion or Querie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The ſeventh and laſt.</note> is, <hi>Why ſo great a latitude in preaching</hi> (i. e.) <hi>upon voluntary choice of Texts and Subjects, and with mens own immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the matter on them, is to be left open; where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding perhaps other Publick Services are ſtinted and reſtrained, either by the uſe of a Form and Liturgy, or elſe by a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and particular Directory?</hi> And the Anſwer to this alſo, is; That,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such Preaching is to be kept open for great and weighty Reaſons, both ſpecial to Chriſtian Churches, and Common to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and both concerning Religion and Government, and the conſiſtency of each with other. As to Religion, it is the Ordinance of God: And as to the Religious ends of the uſe and exerciſe of it, it is appointed both for the propagation of Religion abroad, and for the more particular occaſional inſtruction of the members of any Church at home. As to Government, it is appointed to ſerve the juſt ends and emergent occaſions of it alſo: And ſo of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of each of theſe with the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And for theſe and the like more particular Reaſons, it is, That it hath ever ordinarily been kept open in all Churches.<note place="margin">De rebus &amp; Imper. Luſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. ad Paulum Jovium Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</note>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59463:116"/> yet their preaching is adorned with the gifts and abilities of their Clergy-men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet notwithſtanding the uſe of ſuch Preaching in any Church, may upon ſome occaſions of moment requiring it, not onely be made leſs frequent, but alſo for ſome time totally omitted: For, although the Publick Ordinances of God in matters of Religion do, as ſuch, oblige to the uſe of them <hi>Semper,</hi> and always, yet none of them ſimply <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> and at all times, as the uſual diſtinction in Divinity is. And Preaching, being in it ſelf capable of being ſo far abuſed by corrupt wicked men in any Society, as to be made the moſt potent and prevailing inſtrument, not onely of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing, but alſo of the utter ruining and confounding the affairs of ſuch Society; where ſuch a caſe may perhaps fall out, the uſe of that one Ordinance, either in <hi>tanto</hi> or in <hi>toto,</hi> either in the whole or in part, either for a longer or leſſer time, may and ought to give place to the procuring the wellfare of all the other Ordinances of God,<note place="margin">See, A ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary view, <hi>Edit. Oxford, Anno</hi> 1641.</note> either Civil or Religious. <hi>Biſhop Andrews,</hi> in his ſhort Deſcription of the Church-Governments of both Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, relates it concerning the <hi>Muſcovian Emperour;</hi> That, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of the infinite ſtrifes and contentions amongst Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and by their occaſions amongst others, he forbad preaching utterly throughout all his Dominions; and inſtead thereof, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded certain Sermons of the Greek and Latine Fathers to be Tranſlated, and them to be read in Publick Aſſemblies, without the adding of a word of mens own thereunto, upon pain of death.</hi> But it were to be wiſhed that no ſuch occaſions might be given to Governours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly; this however is to be ſaid in the General, that the uſe of all preaching, as well as of the other Publick Religious Ordinances, is to be ſo modifyed and proportioned, as that it may conſiſt every way, and in its place, with the uſe of the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Ordinances, and with the welfare of the whole charge of the Magiſtrate in any Society. And to this end it is that all thoſe Lawes of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, which are uſed diverſly and according to the diverſe occaſions and conſtitutions of Churches, are every where laid upon it. Sometimes the more ordinary and general matter of preaching, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the matters of neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and of practical Godlineſs are preſcribed in the way of more general direction:<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>1.</hi> De prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatione Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum &amp; Presbyterorum.</note> So in the Laws of <hi>Charlemain, Primo omnium praedicandum eſt omnibus generaliter, &amp;c.</hi> That, <hi>Firſt of all, it is to be preached to all generally.</hi> So in the late Letter of his preſent <hi>Majeſty</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Lord Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the like.

The diffuſed is that which includes the whole Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any Nation diſperſedly taken. The repreſentative, that which conſiſts of ſome ſelect perſons of that Profeſſion, collected and called together: And there are the ſame grounds in Nature for a Church Repreſentative, which there are for any other repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the people in Civil matters whatſoever, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and knowledge of ſome in all Societies above others; and either the difficulty or impoſſibility of calling the whole Society to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. All are not fit for Councel to Princes; and the moſt of men are born to be Ruled, and not to Rule. And, <hi>Deinde, quia difficile plebs convenire caepit, populus certè multo difficilius, in tanta turba hominum neceſſitas ipſa curam Reipublicae ad Senatum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxit,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the New Teſtament. But as to thoſe that require a preſident of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59463:117"/> a National Church to be given in the New Teſtament, it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; the Chriſtian Church then not being national, nor in an ordinary capacity to be ſo. A Church repreſentative is again ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compounded onely of Clergy-men, and the Prince by vertue of his Indirect Power in Spirituals preſiding, (and then it is called a National Synod, or Convocation of Divines) or both of Clericks and Laicks, and the Prince by Vertue of his Supream Power over all preſiding: And both theſe, according to the occaſions of Princes, and the nature of the affairs committed to them to handle. But it is the notion of a Church National diffuſed, which is, and will be principally concerned both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p n="2">II.

And hence it is, that every ſuch National Church is indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon any other, and not at all obliged to the obſervance of the conſtitutions of it as ſuch, and concerning indifferent things; but is to frame and order all things within it ſelf, according to its own proper occaſions. And thoſe that do conſtitute the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon Earth in ſuch a Church in the Eccleſiaſtical Synods, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Preſbyterial, do make way (the corruptions of men being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) for the Eccleſiaſtical perſons invading the Office of the Civil Magiſtrate, and converting clearly into a Pope in the end.<note place="margin">The ends of a Canon of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Liturgy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</note>

               <p n="15">XV.

For, the Canon and Liturgy being thus each of them authorized and enjoyned by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; that which will follow will be, that they will be made uſe of by the National Church, and opened and taught to the people
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59463:120"/> at the Publick Ordinances, and the Doctrines of them will be treated of more at large in Homilies, Catechiſms, good Books, Pieces of practiſe and devotion (for private and retired uſe) and the like: And by theſe means, the due reſpects will be kept up to Government, and the conſiſtency of Religion with it will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; And the ſalvation of ſouls will be provided for, and the Life and Power of Godlineſs ſuccoured. Truly ſouls are precious and of infinite value, both in themſelves, and alſo in reſpect to their ſublime capacity and immortality in another world: they are like the pieces of Silver which the woman ſought for with a candle in the Goſpel. And, as <hi>Toledo</hi> ſaid to the Legate from <hi>Rome</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> upon occaſion, That, <hi>He had heard it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preached, that the ſaving of one Soul was ſo dear to Chriſt,</hi>

               <p n="16">XVI. The ſecond<note place="margin">The Second.</note> of theſe mediate ends is, in reſpect to both the Canon and Liturgy diſtinctly alſo, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the obliging men to the publick profeſſion, in reſpect to the Doctrines contained in the Canon, and to the uſe of the publickly authorized Forms, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Liturgy: And both theſe for the procuring of that Peace and Charity, the great <hi>medium</hi> for the procuring of which ſuch an Unity of profeſſion, and of the uſe of publick worſhip,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib:</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. §. 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> were ſaid to be above; and which Peace and Charity are ſo beneficial both to Religion and Government, and the conſiſtency of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Government (as was ſaid above alſo) and ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture.

There is a notable relation in <hi>Plutarch</hi> to this purpoſe, concerning a crafty King,<note place="margin">De Iſide &amp; O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirid.</note> Who <hi>gueſſing at his Enemies the Aegyptians, their being too ſtrong for him, if they agreed in their minds and Councels, and ſhould band together, took this courſe; He enjoyned each Country to worſhip divers Beaſts, which were enemies by Nature, and would prey upon each other.</hi> And the effect of it was this, That, <hi>Whilſt every one defended his Beaſt, at laſt it came to paſs, that by the enmity of their Beaſts, the people themſelves at unawares became ſuch enemies one to another, that he eaſily ſubdued them.</hi>

Laſt of all,<note place="margin">The Third and laſt.</note> the third and laſt of theſe mediate ends of the Canon and Liturgy are, in reſpect to each of them diſtinctly alſo: And that is, in reſpect to the Canon its reſtraining men from the open divulging of their Opinions in order to the conteſting them; and in reſpect to the Liturgy, the reſtraining them from the

We ſhall only abſolve two <hi>Queſtions</hi> or <hi>Queries</hi> concerning them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the manner of uſing them in Publick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the ſimple uſe of them more privately.</p>
               <p n="19">
                  <note place="margin">The firſt of them.</note>XIX. Firſt, <hi>in what manner in the general they are to be made uſe of in the publick; and what are the circumſtances that are to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch the uſe of them; and particularly to what degree the uſe of them is to be extended,</hi> (viz.) <hi>of what length the ordinary preſcript form of Divine Service, and the other Offices in the Liturgy, ought to be; how frequently Preaching or Sermons are to intervene, and be had, either on the more ſolemn ſtated Sabbaths, or other Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, or on any other the like dayes of publick convening in any Church?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Circumſtances, attending the Ordinances of God, and the manner of uſing them, are ordinarily ſaid to be of two ſorts; either natural, or voluntary and inſtituted. The Natural are only ſecondarily and dependently ſo, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſuch as are taken Naturally to cohere with things only in relation to their being, according to the received cuſtomes of any Country. The voluntary are thoſe which are inſtituted more <hi>ad libitum;</hi> and if they be throughly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they rather are to be ſaid to differ only in degree, then in kind (in this matter) from the former: Both becauſe they are ſuppoſed to be ſuitable to the things ſignified and meant by them, and alſo becauſe there is alwayes ſuppoſed to be a reaſon for the Humane appointment of whatſoever circumſtances ſhall attend ſo weighty matters as the Sacred Ordinances of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The particular wayes and manner in which the Ordinances of God (the means of Knowledge and Grace mentioned) are to be uſed (and as attended with theſe circumſtances) in any Church, are left undetermined in the Divine Law of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And there are only the general Rules laid down concerning all ſuch things in the external regiment of the Church, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of <hi>doing all things decently and in order,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40. and 26.</note> to <hi>edification;</hi> of <hi>ſerving God with reverence and Godly fear,</hi> and the like. But the modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe generals, when reduced into particulars, is left to the diverſe conditions and occaſions of particular Churches, <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc,</hi> and according to preſent circumſtances of affairs. And it was impoſſible that it ſhould have been left otherwiſe, conſidering the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59463:121"/> diverſities of the neceſſities of Countries every way, and that the Chriſtian Church was intended to be ſpread over all the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The putting theſe matters into form then in every ſociety is left ſupreamly and principally to the Supream Magiſtrate: And he hath a right to the doing of it, as he is the perſon who ought to have the framing of the Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity in his Society (as was above mentioned) partly by vertue of his Supream Power over all, and partly by vertue of his indirect power in Spirituals.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 10 §. 2. and 4.</note> Hence the diverſities of cuſtomes and ceremonies attending the Divine Service in divers Churches. Hence the Canonical hours, and the like: Only the Magiſtrate is to ſee that his Divines, aſſiſting him, or any others, do take a ſpecial care, that according to the general Rules of the Divine Law mentioned, all things be done to the promotion of the welfare both of Religion and Government, and the conſiſtency of each with either in this matter. And it is convenient that there be one only form of uſing theſe things (ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the other parts of the Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity) through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Princes Dominions. And it is of great moment, that there be alſo Uniform Vogues or Voices, made to paſs currantly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, concerning the obſervance of all of them.</p>
               <p n="20">XX. The ſecond<note place="margin">The Second.</note> 
                  <hi>Queſtion</hi> or <hi>Querie</hi> then, is, concerning the <hi>ſimple uſe</hi> of theſe Ordinances of God <hi>more privately,</hi> and that in reſpect to the great matter of the <hi>Conventus,</hi> or <hi>Conventiculi,</hi> the <hi>leſſer meetings</hi> in houſes or <hi>Conventicles,</hi> as they are called at this day in <hi>England, (viz.) Whether, and how far forth ſuch Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are Lawful, and accordingly to be permitted by the Prince in any Society?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In the firſt place, there is no doubt but that Prayer and Preaching, and the like exerciſes of Religion, which are made uſe of in thoſe Conventicles, are in themſelves the Ordinances of God. So that that need not to be pleaded for them with ſo great and popular a cry made amongſt the vulgar as it uſeth to be (and hath been in <hi>England</hi>) by the ſupporters of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But then all the Queſtion, is, concerning the uſe of them in ſuch a way; whether, when ſo uſed, they are to be look'd upon as lawfully uſed, and as continuing to be the Ordinances of God? Truly this caſe (as all others) is to be judged from the diverſities of circumſtances attending it. Things in themſelves may be good, but by the abuſe of them made evill. Things in themſelves may be the Ordinances of God; but by the uſe of them in ſuch or ſuch a way, turn'd into the Engines of men to work their deſigns by.

               <p n="3">3. The general Rule then from whence the goodneſs or evil of the circumſtances accompanying them, in this caſe, is to be judged of, is, their tending either to the hurt or benefit of the Publick Charge of the Magiſtrate: If they tend to the hurt of it, it makes them unlawful; if otherwiſe, the contrary. And the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accompanying them, may tend ſo evidently and eminently to the hurt of that charge, that it cannot by any means be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the ſuppreſſion of them. Let us but weigh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe in <hi>England.</hi> Suppoſe they are kept up in any Society, in a time of Parties or Factions ſtirring in it. Suppoſe thoſe Factions only keep them up. Suppoſe that the very Fame and Repute of thoſe perſons who perform the Acts of Praying and Preaching at them do work upon the others who frequent them to be of their Parties; as it will moſt certainly do, and prevail mightily with the weaker ſort of men, although thoſe who are the Orators do
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59463:122"/> not neither ſo directly or expreſly Pray or Preach up their Parties in the mean time. Suppoſe yet further, that theſe Parties ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Publick Ordinances, or National way of Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion in any Society. Suppoſe that they have avowed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and openly declared their intents of altering the preſent Lawful and Eſtabliſhed Government, either in Church or State; and ſo evidently theſe meetings tend to the publick conteſting of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the utter breach of the Peace both in Church and State, and to the overthrow of the preſent Lawful Eſtabliſhed Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both. Suppoſe that the Publick Magiſtrate hath had this long experience of them, that they have been kept up for nothing elſe in the bottom, or by any of the heads of thoſe Parties, and have tended to nothing elſe. Suppoſe yet again that they are kept up at the time of the adminiſtration of the Publick Ordinances. in the Church, and do withdraw men from the partaking in them. Suppoſe laſtly, that upon theſe and the like conſiderations they are ſtrictly prohibited by Lawful Authority, and Laws made by it. Certainly theſe things being weighed, no conſiderate man will concede ſuch meetings to be lawful, and the prayer and preaching that is uſed in them to be uſed in a due way, and to be attended with right cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in the uſe of them. In vain then are the convenings of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians in Houſes (who had a ſpecial command from Heaven (as <hi>Abraham</hi> had for the ſacrificing his Son) for the ſetting up of the Chriſtian Religion by ſuch wayes at that time) alledged for theſe meetings, and the juſtification of them; and the caſe of which is far otherwiſe, in the circumſtances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the caſe of theſe meetings then may be ſo, the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is the perſon who hath the Supream Right of Judging con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and of laying a reſtraint upon the uſe of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God in them: And that by vertue of his indirect power in ſpirituals.<note place="margin">

               </argument>
               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat which is the main drift and ſcope of this Chapter,<note place="margin">The great weight of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Chapter.</note> is of great moment towards the pacification and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Conſcience, in its ſubmiſſion to the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Laws of Princes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the aſſignation of what kind of aſſent it is that is ſuppoſed to the external profeſſion and uſe of things, either in reſpect to matters of Doctrine,<note place="margin">An immediate inward unity of aſſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to be the kind of aſſent here to be mentioned. §. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. §. 9, 11, 12.</note> or Worſhip and Practiſe, in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity.</p>
               <p n="2">II. An immediate inward unity of aſſent then being denyed in the former Chapter, and deny'd to be that kind of aſſent in man which was ſaid (above) to be ſuppoſed to the External Acts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and uſe of publick worſhip; it is evident that it is not it which is here to be aſſigned and fixed upon as a ſufficient ground for ſuch profeſſion, and uſe or practiſe of things.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:59463:126"/>
                  <note place="margin">Yet there may be ſuch an unity of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in men in part.</note>III. But although ſuch an univerſal inward unity of aſſent is not ordinarily poſſible, nor to be expected to be in men; yet however it doth not from thence follow, but that there may be ſuch an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them in part <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in reſpect to ſome things, whether matters of belief or practiſe, and in ſome notions that they have concerning thoſe things. Things may be perhaps ſo plainly and particularly expreſſed, (as is the caſe of the fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion) or elſe there may be the ſame cauſes of the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate notions of things, co-operating in ſeveral perſons at the ſame time, and as to ſome things. And theſe things are poſſible in Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">But yet this is not the kind of it, that is to be fixed upon here neither. <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 7, §. 8. <hi>in fin.</hi>
                  </note>IV. But becauſe (as was ſaid above) that ſuch a profeſſion and uſe of worſhip was enquired after, as might be an ordinary ſtated <hi>medium</hi> for procuring a charitative communion amongſt men; and becauſe the aſſent ſuppoſed to both of them ought to be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable and adequate to the univerſality of them both: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Unity of aſſent (here mentioned) is alſo but partial, either as to things, or perſons, and but accidental, either as to thoſe things, or perſons, or times, and caſes up and down in the world; therefore it is, that this is not the kind of unity of aſcent, which is here to be fixed upon neither.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <note place="margin">The poſitive ſtated, and what that kind of ſuch aſſent is.</note>V. So then we come to the poſitive ſtating of it; and that is, that the kind of inward unity of aſſent, which is ſuppoſed to the outward unity of profeſſion, and uſe of publick worſhip in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Uniformity in any national Church, is, an inward unity of aſſent <hi>in aliquo tertio,</hi> and in ſome <hi>third notions</hi> concerning things.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <note place="margin">The third no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſign'd, in which it is to terminate.</note>VI. And thoſe <hi>third notions</hi> then, in which ſuch aſcent is to terminate, are, thoſe of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of things. Of the truth of them, in reſpect to the Canon of Doctrines, and the matters of Doctrine, which profeſſion of aſſent is to be made to; And of the lawfulneſs of them, in reſpect to the uſe of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the matters of Worſhip and Practiſe, in the uſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of which,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap, 7. §. 12. <hi>in fin.</hi>
                  </note> ſuch profeſſion of aſcent was ſaid (above) to be involved alſo. And this is all the kind of aſſent then, which is ſuppoſed by Princes to be given by men to their Eccleſiaſtical Lawes <hi>(viz.)</hi> that they ſhould believe the Doctrines of their National Church to be true, and their Publick Worſhip to be Lawful. And this Conceſſion of Princes is one of the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal of thoſe derivative Latitudes or Liberties which were ſaid above to belong to private perſons in relation to their performance of obedience to the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhments of thoſe Princes,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. cap. 11. §. 6.</note> and to be alſo the derivative rights of thoſe private perſons in that matter. And, as to the more particular, and next, and immediate notions, under which thoſe private perſons think either of theſe ſorts of things, either Doctrines or Worſhip, to be ſo, either
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59463:126"/> true or lawful; Princes meddle not with them, nor look not upon them as in themſelves belonging to their Province.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The great reaſon then why this kind of inward aſſent,<note place="margin">The Reaſon why it is here to be fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> is it which is here thus to be fixed upon, is, becauſe it hath all the properties which ſuch an aſſent <hi>(viz.)</hi> as muſt ſtand in its place in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity) ought to have; And thoſe are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It permits to men their Liberty of Conſcience, and of the ordinary exerciſe of their judgment of diſcerning (which were aſſerted as their primitive Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Rights above) and alſo their humane neceſſity of variety in their opinions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate notions concerning things,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. §. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> which hath been above alſo more then once aſſerted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is therefore both lawful,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>1.</hi> §. <hi>7.</hi> &amp; Cap. <hi>6.</hi> §. <hi>6.</hi> Vid. &amp; alibi.</note> as ſuppoſed by the Magiſtrate to the external profeſſion, and alſo ordinarily and univerſally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in reſpect to the members of his Society, and the external profeſſion, its being an ordinary ſtated <hi>medium</hi> for charity amongſt them. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſtly, it is therefore alſo, and as it is ſo every ways law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its ſelf, and ordinarily poſſible, a ground ſufficient, both in reſpect to God and Conſcience, for mens making ſuch an outward profeſſion (of aſſent) to Doctrines, and for their uſing the national worſhip.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. This aſſent then to theſe third notions of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that kind of it which men are thus generally ſuppoſed to unite in;<note place="margin">Two cautions ſubjoyned to this the fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> there are only two cautions here further to be ſubjoyned to this our aſſignation of it as ſuch: And thoſe are,</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Firſt of all,<note place="margin">The firſt of them.</note> the firſt reſpecting the poſitive part of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and mens making the external profeſſion mentioned; and that is, <hi>That in order to the making of it, they collect rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally and according to the due Rules of Interpretation</hi> (laid down hereafter) <hi>and not abſurdly and careleſly concerning their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate notions of things.</hi> For otherwiſe, it is trifling with God,<note place="margin">Infra Cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> and colluding with Conſcience, if men ſhall not do their duties in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The ſecond reſpecting the negative part of an Uniformity,<note place="margin">The Second.</note> and mens not injuring the charge of the Magiſtrate by their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-feuds, and breach of the peace by them; and that is alſo, <hi>That although perhaps they may variouſly differ in their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate notions which they have of things, yet that they do not in the mean time divulge thoſe their differences however any way to their ſuch breaking of the peace and publick conteſting of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as is mentioned.</hi> The Scripture ſayes,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note> 
                  <hi>To his own Maſter</hi> every man <hi>ſtandeth or falleth;</hi> and therefore, <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another mans Servant?</hi> And if a man will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the good and charitable office of inſtructing others aright,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59463:127"/> it muſt be done with Meekneſs, Love, Humility, and the like; and there is no room here for mens venting their irregular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and miſtaken zeal, and their <hi>calling for fire from Heaven,</hi> as the Apoſtles ſaid <hi>Elias</hi> did.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion drawne from theſe things.</note>XI. In the laſt place then, if the things here mention'd in this Chapter were duly thought upon, and if the uſe of them were made aright, and as it ought to be in Churches, and according to their variety of occaſions, and by all in their ſeveral places; How little of that murmuring would there be againſt Princes and Church-men, and their Eccleſiaſtical Lawes? How little of that complaining of oppreſſion of conſcience, and the like, which is many times ſo frequent abroad in the world?</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <note place="margin">Two appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons reſolved.</note>XII. Theſe things then being ſaid, two <hi>Queſtions</hi> or <hi>Queries</hi> appendant to them are here laſt of all to be reſolved: And thoſe are;</p>
               <p n="1">1. In relation to the outward acts of profeſſion, and the uſe of Publick Worſhip, their being regulated by Humane Laws; and where ſome one or more perſons may be ſuppoſed to be, who are of ſuch a profeſſion, as is outwardly ſecluded from being at all made in any Society, and which may perhaps ſo differ in the kind of it, either more generally or particularly, from the national pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as that it is contradictorily oppoſite to it, and ſo inconſiſtent with it under any notion whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, in relation to the defence of the True Faith, and that by contending for it.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <note place="margin">The firſt of them.</note>XIII. Firſt then, <hi>How far forth the Magiſtrate may</hi> de Jure <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel men in the caſe mentioned, to unite with the national profeſſion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Negatively, and on the peoples part, he may compel them univerſally and abſolutely not to make the contrary profeſſion of any falſe Religion: And ſo he may compel them alſo generally and limitedly, and where his publick occaſions do require it, not to make the profeſſion of the true Religion to ſuch or ſuch degrees of ſolemnity: and they are bound to obey, where no ſpecial reaſon obligeth to the contrary, ſay the Caſuiſts, and all the Divines. And the reaſons of theſe things are evident, both from the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Divine Law. From the Law of Nature, becauſe it is not the intent of the true Religion at any time, by the ſame act of profeſſion more to hurt humane Society then to benefit it ſelf. And from the Divine Law; See <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.16. to 23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.13. <hi>Jo.</hi> 10.39, 40. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Negatively, on the Magiſtrates part; he may not compel them in a direct and alſolute ſence to the poſitive act of uniting with the national profeſſion; and that becauſe the conceſſion of ſuch right of compulſion in him, includes conceſſion of Sin: And they ought not neither to be compell'd by him, either where the national Religion is falſe, and ſo the act of profeſsion of it is ſinful in its ſelf,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59463:127"/> or elſewhere it is againſt Conſcience with them, and ſo that act is ſinful by accident: And therefore the Primitive Councels of the Chriſtian Church enjoyned repentance and other ſpiritual puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the caſe of <hi>Sacrificing to Idols, eating in their Temples,</hi> and the like, and that whether through compulſion or otherwiſe: So the <hi>Ancyran</hi> Councels, <hi>Can.</hi> 8. and <hi>Can.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,<note place="margin">Concil. Ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. apud Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranz. Vid.</note> and ſo others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, and poſitively, in reſpect to both the Magiſtrate and the People: But yet the Magiſtrate, on his part, may compel them on their part, in an elective and relative ſenſe <hi>(i. e.)</hi> either to change the ſoyle, or ſuffer preſent penalties, even to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and death it ſelf,<note place="margin">

And theſe general Rules are to be applyed to all particular caſes.

               <p n="5">
                  <note place="margin">The Second.</note>V. The ordinary way then for the accompliſhing theſe and all ſuch things, is, <hi>By the making uſe of a Synod of Divines;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the laſt way of finding out truth in this world in matters of Religion; therefore nature directs to the uſe of it <hi>(i. e.)</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ordinarily, and where there is not ſome ſpecial and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reaſon againſt it in any Princes Dominions. And this hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ordinarily been the way uſed for the accompliſhing ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in all Ages of the Chriſtian Church, and in all Times and Countries down along the Ages of the world. Innumerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59463:129"/> might be given of it: And this Synod of Divines hath thus in the general, and as ſuch, an antecedent and natural right more properly to the handling of ſuch matters before they are convened: And alſo ſuch a ſubſequent right, both upon that account, and alſo more determinately and particularly, by vertue of the power convening them, when they are ſo convened. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe and the like accounts it is, that the uſe of them ordinarily hath been eſtabliſhed, and aſſerted by the Civil Laws of Countries: and that they, when ſitting, have been accounted as the Church National repreſentative (as in <hi>England,</hi> and according to the Laws and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions of that Country, although their conſultations nevertheleſs are not laid as Laws upon the People, unleſs firſt approv'd of in Parliament, and ſtamped as ſuch with the Royal Aſſent;) and therefore it is uſual alſo for the Prince, either by himſelf alone, or elſe together with ſome of the Repreſentatives of his other Eſtates, to come into conjunction with them; and that they and he be both of them conjunctly called by the ſame name of the Church, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Church National Repreſentative.</hi> And it is profitable for Societies that it be ſo <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that their Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions (and whether purely or only mixtly ſuch) may come under the more ſacred notion to the people, and ſo have the better obedience perform'd to them: Neither hath this any thing of <hi>dolus malus</hi> in it of it ſelf, and ſo long as the conſtitutions mentioned are lawful. In the mean time the Rights of the Prince, in relation to this Synod, are alwayes, and in every National Church to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: and that more particularly for the ſake of the conſiſtency of Religion with Government.

               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The <hi>Caſe</hi> then concerning <hi>the Princes having power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Heretical Synods,</hi> is from hence eaſily to be determined: For if they ſhall have a right of ſitting, and of making what Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they pleaſe, and of framing what Doctrines they pleaſe, and the like; (although they are not under the notion of having publick Authority on their ſide) yet if they ſhall but make uſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal notion of Religion any way for the perſwading men of the truth and goodneſs of theſe things, and ſhall be left at liberty to do it; Who is there amongſt Princes that ſhall be able to ſtand, or to ſecure the welfare of any part of his charge in the mean time? Wherefore the Magiſtrates Right of prohibiting and ſuppreſſing theſe conventions of men is in the ſame manner dictated by Nature, as we ſaid of the rights of ordering his own National Synod juſt now.<note place="margin">The caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Princes hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of prohibiting Heretical Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</note> And it belongs to him partly by vertue of his indirect power in Spirituals, and partly by vertue of his Supream Power over all. And in the ſtrain of theſe things run the <hi>Imperial Laws. Haeretici ſynacteria, ſeu collectas facere non poſſunt, aut paraſynaxes, aut Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodos, aut ordinationes, aut baptiſmata, aut exarchos habere, aut paternitates, ſeu abatias, aut defenſiones inſtituere, aut curare ſeu adminiſtrare villas, per ſeipſos, aut per interpoſitas perſonas, aut quid probibitorum facere: Qui tranſgreſſus haec fuerit ultimum ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicium luit,</hi>

And laſt of all, if it be aſked here, <hi>which are Haeretical Synods?</hi> Truly that muſt of neceſſity, from his right of prohibiting them, be left to the Supream Magiſtrate in every Country to determine. And although it be from the connotation of the terms, that that Synod only is in it ſelf Heretical, which any wayes tends to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Hereſie; yet the Chief Magiſtrate ordinarily determines every Synod to be ſo, which he judges to be ſo, and which in ſuch a way (as he deemeth) ſeparates from his national Church. And it cannot be helped, but that it muſt be ſo: Neither, <hi>rebus ſic ſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> and as things ſtand in the world, is there any other temper, or general fixation to be found out for the Governours of Humane Societies in this buſineſs? And the Univerſal Government of them, and the Supream ſwaying of their affairs in the mean time, is to be left to the Divine Providence, to order it as it ſhall pleaſe; and men are to acquieſce in a due manner under them, and with prayers and ſupplications for them.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. We come then next to the <hi>Rules</hi> to be obſerved in the manner of compoſing the Canon and Liturgy,<note place="margin">The firſt Rule to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the number of doctrines, or ſubalternate kinds of forms which they conſiſt of.</note> which relate to the number of Doctrines, or ſubalternate kinds of forms, which they are to conſiſt of: And the firſt of them is, <hi>That the Magiſtrates and Churches Power of enjoyning indifferent things (as adjuncts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip, and Rites and cuſtomary Ceremonies peculiar to ſuch or ſuch a National Church) be conceded to them:</hi> And that in relation to the welfare both of Religion and Government; and therefore it ought accordingly to be conceded to them: That they may aſſert them, or propound and enjoyn them to be uſed, either in the Canon or Liturgy in either of their capacities. And this right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Magiſtrate, and Church National repreſentative made uſe of by him in either of thoſe wayes which we have mentioned; and is one of the more particular rights belonging to the Magiſtrate Supreamly, and in his way, for the ſupport of his more general right of the framing his Uniformity.

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. §. 15.</note> but it is meant here prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally as an act of caution: not but that any other Doctrines, which are not particularly and expreſly mentioned in the Canon (ſo long only as they be according to the tenour of it) may be ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught to the people: but only the principal points of caution are, both poſitively, that the Doctrines expreſſed in the Canon ſhould be true; and alſo negatively, that none aliene from them, or contradictory to them, ſhould be ſo taught to the people. And the like alſo are the reſpects that this cautionary act hath to the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy: not that it abſolutely and univerſally excludes the uſe of any other forms or ways of worſhip, then what are ſet down expreſly in the ſtated body and volumne of the Liturgy, (only ſo they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intent and tenour of them) but onely that it intends poſitively to ſee that thoſe ſet down in the Liturgy be lawful; and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59463:134"/> negatively, that none any ways detracting from them, or utterly contradictory to them, be uſed in publick. And this then being the laſt act of the Magiſtrate in the framing his Uniformity, it preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all former acts requiſite in order to it, and ſuppoſeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſively its paſſing thus upon all the matters of the Uniformity mentioned. And this not only for the ſeveral reaſons which have been more particularly and topically mentioned heretofore; but alſo becauſe, there being many in all Societies (and ſuch as ever will be) whoſe both opinions and practiſes in Religion will be always brute, and led only by cuſtome; better it were that both their doctrines and worſhip ſhould be thus provided for them and ſecured (as far forth as humane condition in this world will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) then that they ſhould be otherwiſe left open to the ſeduction of Hereticks, and the wild and pernicious ways of the ſeveral ſorts of deceivers. And as to others, who are led by reaſon, there is ſtill room for the exerciſe of their judgment of diſcerning in relation to all theſe things in the mean time.</p>

               <p n="3">III. And in the firſt place, thoſe Rewards (as in other caſes, ſo in this) are either of Profit, Honour, or Pleaſure, or elſe mixt, of all, or either of them. And theſe things, we recited above, as the matters of this world ordinarily valued by men: and either of thoſe ſorts of rewards again, are either more common to many (as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Immunities eſtabliſh'd by Law, and ſuch as are frequently

               <p n="4">IV. And although it be true, that both Church-men, and others (concern'd any ways in the matters of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity) are obliged to the doing of their duties (according to the beſt of their capacities and abilities) by that tye they have upon them from God, and thoſe eternal reſpects they bear to another world; yet while Humane Nature is in them, and they partake of humane infirmities (as they concern them in this Spiritual ſenſe) there muſt be the preſent ſupport and temptation of temporal rewards alſo to encourage them to deſerts and enterpriſes accordingly.

The original then, and moſt natural intents of all ſorts of emoluments and gratifications, conferr'd by the publick in the more ſpecial way mentioned, were principally two, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the rendering Princes Magnificent, and the encouraging merits and deſerts: And the former of theſe in its moſt eminent capacity was alwayes inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the latter. So that Princes were never found to have acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more Glory and Renown (as well as to have benefited the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick) then by their having beſtowed matters of reward (proper to perſons of any faculty or profeſſion) upon the moſt eminently and remarkably deſerving (and eſpecially deſerving from the publick) in that profeſſion.</p>

But in relation to theſe things, it was quickly found in the ſetting up of all Common Weals, that (partly becauſe of the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mens performing acts of conſpicuous and more then ordinary merit, and partly becauſe of the prevalence of Avarice, Self-love, and the like corrupt affections with men) <hi>Friendſhip, Kindred, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, private Service,</hi> and the like ſtept in, and almoſt ſpoiled all: Eſpecially Princes themſelves grew more ſupine and careleſs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to theſe matters alſo, when at any time of their Empire, there were a greater ſtore of ſuites and importunities thus qualified, and their affairs ſeemed to be in a more compleat poſture of preſent ſettlement and tranquillity; So that they thought they needed not ſo much men of ſervice.

And the ordinary neceſſity of this perquiſite to the ſtate and Dignity of Princes, is evident from hence; <hi>(i. e.)</hi> from the miſchiefs that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, either where it is not in a ſufficient manner or meaſure annexed to the Supream Power; or elſe where the Church-men, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of them, are left to be, for their income and maintenance, at the devotion of the people.

               <p n="9">IX. Let us come to the ſecond<note place="margin">The Second.</note> 
                  <hi>Rule</hi> to be alſo obſerved in this matter: And that is, <hi>That no Eccleſiaſtical Promotion ſhould be too great, and ſo as to ſtand in any probable capacity of over-topping the Princes power in his Dominions:</hi> Eſpecially if it be beſtow'd by, and depend upon a forraign power, as is the caſe of the <hi>Cardinals Hats</hi> beſtowed by the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> But yet ſtill the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtate, in the Dominions of Princes, is, in its Honours and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be ſuited with the Temporal: And that both for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſake of Religion (the affairs of which the Eccleſiaſtical Eſtate is more immediately and directly converſant in attending upon) and alſo that the inferiour Clergy, in relation to the ordinary matters of juſtice diſpenſed by the Laws, may have their Protectors and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59463:145"/> as well as others, upon any occaſion. And this is the reaſon why divers Governments, and the divers ſorts of them, have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly modified theſe things, for the better accommodating and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the affairs of their Societies.</p>

               <p n="2">II. The Magiſtrates intent then,<note place="margin">The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates intent, concerning the internal notions in men, ſtated negatively.</note> as to thoſe inward notions in mens minds; Firſt of all Negatively:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he doth not at all, in his Eccleſiaſtical Laws, intend the injoyning upon men ſuch and ſuch more particular and immediate notions concerning things: And the Reaſons of this have been given above in their proper places, where an univerſal inward unity of opinion in men hath been denyed to be either any of the intents of a Canon and Liturgy, or elſe that kind of inward aſſent, which is ſuppoſed to the external acts of profeſſion, and uſe of Publick Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Much leſs doth the Church or Magiſtrate intend the forcing any man to any kind of aſſent whatſoever: And that whether it be either under any immediate, or elſe under any mediate and third notion: And that becauſe the forcing an aſſent in men, is both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, as a means to be uſed; and alſo impoſſible, as an end to be
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59463:149"/> obtained; beſides the impertinency of inward aſſent immediately, and in it ſelf, to the Magiſtrate and his occaſions. Outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion indeed may be forc'd, but inward aſſent can never: Although the forcing of outward profeſſion alſo, if it be ſpecifically and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly endeavoured, be irrational and wicked, as hath been ſaid.

               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">And alſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively.</note>III. Let us come then to the poſitive intent of the Magiſtrate in this matter.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <note place="margin">And that firſt more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</note>IV. And that firſt more generally, is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he intendeth mens profeſſion and uſe of things to be according to their inward notions, both mediate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, in each of their capacities; and not that they ſhould make (in reſpect to either ſort of thoſe notions) either a bruit or falſe profeſſion: And if they do ſo, it is their own fault, and not his. And although he doth not, yet Conſcience ſhould, and God doth take an actual and judicial cognizance of it. And, in the mean time, it being ſin, whatſoever is not of Faith, it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the Magiſtrate ſhould intend mens ſinning againſt God any wayes in the making their profeſſion, or practiſing the uſe of things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Magiſtrate alſo wiſheth men a right notion <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſuch as may be right in it ſelf, as well as ſuch as may ſeem right to them, for the founding their profeſſion and uſe of things upon: For he wiſheth them every wayes abſolute welfare in his Uniformity. And in this ſenſe it is, that the ſpecial direction of Gods Spirit, and an unity of Truth in the minds of men, and the like, is many times prayed for, in the ſtated Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and ſuch other publick writings of Churches. And the Canon of Doctrine alſo is propoſed, as a means whereby God may ſo far forth as he ſhall pleaſe, work ſuch an unity in them.<note place="margin">Secondly, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. And the latitudes conceded in relation to them.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Yet in the interim, and notwithſtanding theſe things, as the liberty of opening, and of mens uſe of their judgment of diſcerning, is all along ſuppoſed to be conceded to them in the general; So alſo, all juſt and more particular <hi>Latitudes</hi> of it are
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59463:149"/> conceded to them in like manner in relation to their fixing theſe Notions concerning things, which we are here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And thoſe <hi>Latitudes</hi> are, that a man ſhould profeſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To the Canon and Liturgy themſelves, and in the general, only as humane things, and ſtamped with humane authority, and compoſed by fallible men, and the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>And ſo alſo,</hi> as to the particular Doctrines of the Canon, and forms of Worſhip in the Liturgy, <hi>That a man ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs aſſent to them, and the uſe of them, only under what more particular and further notion his judgment leads him to:</hi> And that not onely as to the diverſity of notion in the nature of it reſpecting the thing, but alſo as to the diverſity of it, in relation to the reſpect it hath to the more or leſs firmneſs of it in a mans mind. And alſo a man is allowed to profeſs aſſent</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Doctrines ſeeming to him certainly true, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch certain Doctrines; and to forms of Worſhip ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him certainly lawful, under the notion of ſuch certainly lawful, and ſo to uſe them accordingly; And to both theſe, as falling under what degree of certainty he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſo to Doctrines and Forms of Worſhip ſeeming to him only probable, only under the notion of ſuch probable: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Rule of acting from Faith ſtill being proceeded by, and the moſt probable of things (either to be believed or done) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed upon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And Laſtly; <hi>The ſum of all in this matter is, That all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular latitudes are conceded to a man, in relation to theſe things, which are not deſtructively contradictory to the third notions of the Canon and Liturgy, their being true and lawful, and ſo to the Magiſtrates Eccleſiaſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, and ſo to his publick charge preſerv'd by it in the latter end.</hi> For as the Magiſtrate is not ſuppoſed to intend the denyal of that degree of liberty in this matter to any man, which is onely juſt, and of no evil conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; So alſo he muſt never be ſuppoſed at all to allow of that, which ſhall be deſtructive to him and his publick affairs. <hi>Ne<expan>

In the laſt place then, the appendant <hi>Queſtion</hi> or <hi>Querie</hi> that is here to be reſolved, concerning the negative part of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, and a mans not divulging his Opinion, and that particularly in the caſe of his down-right diſſenting from any Doctrine in the Canon, or form of worſhip in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, <hi>(viz.)

                  <hi>or Form of Worſhip in a National Church, rather then as much as in him lies to oppoſe it by divulging the contrary, and ſuffering in Teſtimony againſt it,</hi> is of kin to the <hi>Queſtion</hi> above mentioned, of contending for the Faith; but is the negative oppoſite to that poſitive, and will be determined from the ſeveral following concluſive propoſitions; And thoſe are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Doctrine of Tolleration by private men takes no place in the poſitive part of an Uniformity, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in thoſe things which a man either uſeth, as to his practiſe, or makes profeſſion of aſſent to, as to his belief: And the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch tolleration of ſuch things includes a contradiction to the uſe and profeſſion mentioned, and ſo renders both of them ſinful: But a ſinful, either profeſſion or uſe of things, and that which is falſe and contrary to Faith, is not that kind of either, which is laid down as a <hi>medium</hi> for a charitative communion in an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Uniformity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The uſe of things and forms of Worſhip, as to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, is here ſuppoſed to be more general; becauſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy being ſtated, the uſe of it, or, one way or another the partaking in the uſe of it, is ſuppoſed accordingly to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common to all: But then profeſſion of aſſent, more ſpecially in reſpect to the Canon of Doctrines, is to be diſtinguiſhed: And it is either definite or indefinite, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in reſpect to the object matter of it, or the Doctrines which profeſſion is to be made to. The indefinite is, when it is not neceſſarily and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely limited or determined, (either by any Act of a mans own, or act or intent of the Magiſtrate) to a certain number of things; and the definite is the contrary: And the one ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily takes place in the ſpecial ſort of profeſſors, and ſuch as are more ſtrictly tyed up, either by Oaths, ſubſcriptions, or the like in any National Church: And the other in the community, and contrary ſort of perſons: But it is the latter of theſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the generality and common ſort of Church-members, who are here more principally and ordinarily concerned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Doctrine of Tolleration by private men in any ſuch caſe as this is, in the general, is expreſly aſſerted, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by the Divine Law of Chriſt; In that Text of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 14.22. Haſt thou Faith? Have it to thy ſelf before
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59463:150"/> God, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> doſt thou believe ſuch or ſuch a thing, either to be true, or not true, lawful, or not lawful? Enjoy thine own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief for the ſatisfaction of thine own conſcience: And that is as far as thou art (generally, and without a more ſpecial Call, and particular charitative obligation) concern'd.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The more particular qualification of this Doctrine, and how far forth ſuch a Tolleration in this particular caſe, ought to be practiſed, is ſtated by the dictate of the Law Natural: And that from the General Rule for the determination of all ſuch caſes in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, and which hath been all along hitherto mention'd. And that is, <hi>So far forth as it may make to the publick welfare of the charge of the Magiſtrate,</hi> which alwayes includes in it the ſum of the two Tables of <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſo frequently mentioned by the Caſuiſtical Divines, and as being parallel to this in the ſtating their caſe in a notion ſeparate from an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity) <hi>(viz.)</hi> the glory of God, and the good of our Neighbour in any Society.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The concluſion of all then, from theſe prefatory poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is, That from the meaſuring this caſe, in relation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular things or Doctrines in an Uniformity, men are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the value and worth of ſuch Doctrines in Religion; The Service they may otherwiſe do to God in their Calling, if they do not incur the penalties of an Uniformity by their divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Opinions againſt the preſent Eccleſiaſtical Lawes; the high valuation that is to be had by every one of the welfare of the Magiſtrates Charge, and of Charity and Peace in the Church and State in order to it, and the like. And if theſe things be but conſidered, it is not ordinarily to be ſuppoſed, that there are things of ſuch weight, and ſo unwarily propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any Canon of Doctrines in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity, as firſt, to deſerve a mans totall diſſent from them, and after his violating the Common Peace and Profeſſion, and ſtirring up Contentions, by reaſon of any real and ſo groſs erroneouſneſs that is in them. And theſe things do alſo in a more eminent notion concern the caſe of <hi>Revolting</hi> in any Church; and as that alſo hath its ſpecial reference to a preſuppoſed definite profeſſion. Laſt of all then, as to thoſe (many times found in all Churches) who unwarily preſume that they may vent their diſſentings, in both theſe ſorts of caſes mentioned, when and how they pleaſe: And that God, and Conſcience, and the Lawes in any Society, are ſufficiently ſatisfied, if they do but ſubject themſelves in the mean time to the penalties annexed to an Uniformity. They are to remember that ſuffering is not at any time, or in any caſe to be incurr'd, but upon juſt cauſe and good grounds for it, and where doing, by reaſon of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59463:151"/> malignity of the thing to be done, cannot be: And that, not it, but obedience is the primary intent of all Laws; and ſo even of any Penal Law whatſoever. And in vain alſo are the examples of the Apoſtles here alleadg'd for mens irregularity, divulging of their Opinions in Societies: Whoſe caſe, of their firſt planting the Chriſtian Religion in the world, was ſo rare and ſingular in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it, as that the like cannot poſſibly now be met with in any Church whatſoever.</p>

Theſe then being both the ſorts of Teſtimonials to be given in, in an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity; there is one thing, in thoſe that give them in, which there ought to be a ſpecial regard had to by them; and that is, their ſincerity and reallity of intent in their ſo giving them in, and exhibiting of them: And this is that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes them to be formally ſuch as to them. But otherwiſe they are in their intentions, but materially ſuch as to others, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures and deceipts, as to them. Thoſe then who have ſowed the contrary ſeeds of Doctrine in Churches (like <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>liſſes</hi> feignedly ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalt in the furrows) are here to be condemned. Such are the Doctrines of being Actively and Paſſively preſent at Church-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; Of uſing equivocation, mental reſervation, and the like, in Oaths, and the like Sacred pledges: As if men might in theſe kinds of matters triumph innocently with him;
<q>

                  </q> But theſe Doctrines are Hypocritical in the ſight of God; and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, deſtructive to humane affairs; and have been invented for the ſerving of turns, in caſes of irregular commotions in Common-weals, and for the laying up of parties in ſilence againſt another day; and who (like <hi>Cadmus</hi> his teeth from the Earth) may upon occaſion ſtart up men of ſteele.

Laſt of all, we come to aſſign to what things, and matters of duty theſe teſtimonials oblige: And ſo alſo,</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Firſt of all, the teſtimonials given in to indefinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion oblige to indefinite matter; and thoſe to definite, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite matter: In both, the matter is according to the profeſſion, and the obligation is according to the matter, and the latitude of it. And the ſort of this Profeſſion, called indefinite, is here thus to be aſſerted, becauſe it is in all Churches generally indefinite in it ſelf; it not being determined by any thing. If the intent of the Magiſtrate (in the very propoſing of his Uniformity, and the Laws of it to be obſerved) be ſaid to determine it; it will be denyed, that there is any ſuch intent of his imported in that Act of Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59463:155"/> And that becauſe the indefinite profeſſion mentioned hath all the properties ſuitable to the ſeveral notions and modes of things concern'd in ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity. For, as on the one hand, it doth not neceſſitate to a total profeſſion; ſo, on the other hand alſo, it doth not ſuppoſe, but that the profeſſion in the mean time may be totall; or elſe however, but that the Canon of Doctrines and Liturgy are ſo warily and ſkilfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, (the latitudes alſo which have been mentioned, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the making this profeſſion being conſidered) as that the profeſsion mentioned will be ordinarily deficient, but in ſome, either very ſmall, or few things. And then it follows, that it is better for the publick charge of the Magiſtrate, that the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental caſe of tolleration by private perſons ſhould be left open to the Generality of the members of any National Church; (they not violating the common profeſsion of any outward Act in the mean time) nor he, nor any one elſe, not taking any cognizance of any ſuch tolleration as to any particular perſons) then that (they being on the contrary tyed up to a total definite profeſsion) they ſhould for every, either particular or ſmall diſſent, be forced to violate the common profeſsion mentioned, either by changing the Soyle (it is ten to one declaredly for that cauſe) or elſe by ſciſmatically publiſhing thoſe their diſſentings at home. If the edge of theſe things be again turn'd back upon us, as to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite profeſsion of thoſe ſelect ſorts of perſons mentioned: And if it be ſaid, that the inconvenience will be the ſame in any National Church as to them: The anſwer is, that thoſe ſpecial ſorts of perſons are but few comparatively, in any Church: That the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſons for their ſpecial ſort of obligation have been partly mentioned: That they are generally of more knowledge to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and reconcile things: Or that any of them however have the liberty not to enter upon ſuch imployments in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, as require their giving in their Teſtimonials to ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite profeſſion as hath been mentioned. And then this liberty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, it is all the reaſon in the world, that the reſpects of private perſons in this matter ſhould give place to thoſe of the Publick.<note place="margin">Againſt <hi>Knott.</hi> See, in his Preface, §. 39.</note> The judgement then of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> concerning the Uniformity of <hi>England</hi> is here to be reprehended, <hi>(viz.)

And ſuch is the uſing the inſtruments of the Uniformity appointed by the Magiſtrate, in reſpect to the welfare of the Uniformity it ſelf. And the uſe of ſuch inſtruments is diverſly preſcribed, and according to the diverſity of the natural and ordinary intent of them, in all Churches, and as hath been all along hitherto, in the places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the mention of theſe things, mentioned by us: And as to their tending as ſuch to their immediate general end; things and caſes, and circumſtances concerning both, are to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully heeded, by him that will aright, and as he ought to do, make uſe of them to that end. And in ſuch caſes, where rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and prudence ſhall ſuggeſt it, the mind of the Law-giver is oftentimes to be preferred before the Letter of the Law: And that alſo is to be alwayes judg'd of by its more eminently tending to the general end mentioned.</p>

And that is, that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59463:157"/> to perſons intelligent, and who are ſufficient (both in reſpect to prudence as well as perſpicacity) to judge of ſuch things: God and Nature have allowed the liberty of the ordinary exerciſe of their judgment of diſcerning univerſally, and according to the latitude of its adequate object, and in relation to all the ſorts either of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or Forms of worſhip mentioned in any National Church: And that for many reaſons, relating both to the good of Religion and Government, and the conſiſtency of Religion with Government. But to the vulgar, and perſons inſufficient actually and ordinarily not ſo. And the reaſons for this are evident, <hi>(viz.)</hi> becauſe that, as the ordinary medling of ſuch perſons with matters purely ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and opinionative (as thoſe terms are taken in their more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe) is as to them impertinent; ſo alſo is their actual medling with ſuch matters of Religion leſs fundamental and doubtfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed generally and ordinarily of very ill conſequence, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, both to themſelves, and the publick charge of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate: For, it takes them off from looking after the fundamentals of Religion, which muſt bring them to Heaven: It influences their brains to an exceſs (as mad-mens are) with the too great nicity of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It makes them a fit prepar'd matter for any Hereſiark to work upon, and lead away, and the like, both to the ruine of all ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial practiſe and ſound Religion, and of all Humane Society. And for theſe and the like Reaſons it is, that the ſtate of this caſe here laid down, as it is aſſerted and countenanced by the Scriptures, ſo alſo it hath been generally practiſed by the Governours in all Societies.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>That they make not their inward heats of ſpirit, accompanying their opinings, to be the Rule by which to judge ſuch their opinings to be true.</hi> For this leads directly to Enthuſiaſme.

Beſides, Holineſs is many times pretended and counterfeited on purpoſe for the guilding over of mens actions and deſigns, and the dazling the eyes of the people, who are not able to put a difference betwixt ſhews and things, and are taken with nothing ſo much as with ſhews, and with no ſhews ſo much as with thoſe of Religion.<note place="margin">Sozom.

In <hi>Spain,</hi> and generally where the inquiſition is in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> men are not permitted ſo much as to diſcourſe in private a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the matters of the Uniformity: And if they do ſo, any of the company is taxable by the ſame Court, for not detecting and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. In the <hi>European</hi> Churches, diſſenting from the <hi>Roman,</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally is held the quite contrary courſe. And both Table diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and others, both <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> concerning the matters mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are tolerated. And in ſome, both of thoſe Churches, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Roman</hi> communion, there is a mixture of profeſſions both tollerated and countenanced in their ſeveral degrees: As in <hi>France, Holland, Poland,</hi> and the like Countries at this day. And every State Acts in this matter according to its preſent occaſions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But I intend not here only to give particular inſtances of theſe things;<note place="margin">The reſtraints and Liberties common to all Churches here to be laid down.

The Querie concerning the permiſſion of mixtures of profeſſion obviated.</note> but to lay down the reſtraints and liberties which are common and ordinary (and ought to be ſo) generally to all Churches.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. And becauſe the matters of reſtraint and liberty are privately oppoſite; therefore by the poſition or removal of either of them, in relation to the members of Churches, the other will be diſcern'd.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The ways of mens divulging their Opinions then, are either more or leſs ſolemn. The leſs ſolemn ways are, by private Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Conferences, and the like. The more ſolemn, by publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Printing, and the like. And, concerning both theſe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints and liberties mention'd are to be aſſign'd.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But firſt of all, the <hi>Querie</hi> is here to be obviated; <hi>Why out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion (taken in an abſtracted ſenſe, in reſpect to either of theſe or the like particular ways of venting of Opinions mentioned) ſince it is in it ſelf one of the more ſolemn ways of ſuch venting of them, is in many Societies tollerated; where perhaps either of the particular ways of either ſort of them mentioned is not? Anſw.</hi> The Anſwer will be from the conſideration of the different effects of theſe ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ways of divulging of Opinions upon the charge of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and the ſtate of humane affairs: And that is, that becauſe that the ways of venting of Opinions by words, (either ſpoken or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) are naturally apt and fit, as to give men more particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, ſo alſo to excite in them both more particular, and alſo more vehement paſſions concerning things, then general and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted profeſſion is; and ſo conſequently, where different matters of Religion are, are more apt (by far) to hurle them into Religious conteſts (ſo many ways dangerous to the publick:) Therefore it is, that the way of contradictory divulging of Opinions by the mixture of profeſſions is tollerated (and that with ſafety to Societies, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59463:160"/> ſhews) though not ſo compleat as it otherwiſe might be) where notwithſtanding the other wayes of ſo divulging them by words (at leaſt to the ſame degrees of ſolemnity) are denyed to men. For by particularities and vehemencies (both in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and others) are the moſt irregular and dangerous paſſions ſtirred up amongſt men.<note place="margin">Lib <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>9. §. 8.</hi> ad fin.</note> And to this topick is the uſe of thoſe extreams (heretofore mention'd) in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>(viz.)</hi> of prohibiting Books in the vulgar tongue, of eſtabliſhing the doctrines of the uſe of Images, general devotion, implicit faith, and the like, to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if any man will ſeek after a reaſon of them.</p>

Firſt, as to the matter of mens opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>VII. Theſe things then being thus ſaid, we come next to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the more particular reſtraints and liberties mentioned: And thoſe are,</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. Firſt of all, as to the matter of mens Opinions: And ſo firſt, in reſpect to the Canon and Liturgy, ſome things perhaps are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, neither by the Canon nor Liturgy, nor otherwiſe: And ſo are neither doctrines, nor preſcript forms of worſhip of the National Church. And in ſuch things there is in all Churches ordinarily a greater liberty of divulging mens Opinions ſuppoſed to be conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them; ſo in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to their learned mens actual debating points not defined; and the like in other Churches proportionably, and according to their ſeveral particular conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The general Rule ſtill being heeded of the publick charge of the Magiſtrate its not being damnified, neither by the breach of the peace, nor otherwiſe. 2. Some Opinions perhaps are diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from the Canon, proper to the caſe of indefinite profeſſion; and men are to be very wary of divulging them, to the hurt of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick authority, by which the whole Society is preſerved. 3. And laſtly, Some Opinions alſo are differences about the Canon, proper to the caſe of definite profeſſion: And there is uſually ſuppoſed to be a leſſer degree of reſtraint held over the divulging of them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the matter of mens Opinions is conſiderable alſo, in reſpect to Religion: And ſo, 1. Some things are controverſal, and dubious, and the like; and ſo fit to be debated only ordinarily in Academies, and places of Learning, amongſt Schollers, and perſons intelligent. And it were no matter if ſuch controverſies were, to a degree fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, permitted in Churches; if it were but to keep wits in ure and imployment, and to provide Champions for thoſe Churches upon occaſion.<note place="margin">Apud.

               <p>Secondly, ſome things are practical, and ſuch as concern good life and Godlineſs. And Scripture, and Reaſon, and Prudence, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a greater liberty about them.

In the ſecond place, we come to the liberties,<note place="margin">Secondly, as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</note> in reſpect to the manner of mens divulging their Opinions. And ſo alſo, 1. It ſhould be with humility and ſubmiſſion, and not on the contrary, with pride and confidence, and ſingularity, and the like, at leaſt before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 2. There is a leſs degree of liberty conceded to intemperate zeal, and undue vehemence of aſſertion, and the like. Not that it is at all the intent of the Uniformity to extinguiſh the Noble and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous heats of ſuch zeal as is truly Chriſtian, but only to regulate it, when it is unduly exerted. Where is mens zeal for practical God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? for the evident duties of the ſecond Table? The thoughts of theſe things do uſe to be buried many times as deep as the centre, under the duſts of unprofitable and perhaps malignant Opinions; which uſe to be raiſed when men have a mind to innovate in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to gain the trophies of honour and temporal emoluments out of the hands of others. 3. Paſſionate expreſſions, and ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on others ſhould be laid aſide alſo. The Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were fain to obſerve ſuch rules as theſe, for the preſervation even of their firſt Chriſtian Churches, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>If in any thing,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, ye are otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you.</hi> And reflections and paſſions, when once grown popular and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are like the riſings of the waves at Sea before a tempeſt, and do argue commotions and ſtorms to be approaching in Societies.</p>
               <p n="10">X. In the third and laſt place,<note place="margin">Thirdly, as to perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging of them alſo.</note> the quality of the perſons divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinions, is alſo to be heeded: And ſo, 1. Young men are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be adviſed to a greater ſilence: And men of mean and weak parts: And for theſe principally is the uſe of Homilies appointed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in Churches. 3. It is but reaſon that perſons ſuſpected or obſerv'd to be ſeditious, diſloyal, and the like, ſhould be more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watch'd over, and more nearly reſtrained, if there be occaſion. And then,</p>
               <p n="11">XI. Fourthly and laſtly, all theſe ſorts of perſons and things,<note place="margin">Fourthly and laſtly, as to the time of divulging them.</note> and the like to them, are then moſt of all to be heeded, when the preſent temper of the people is ſeditious, and any ways inflamed, either by ſome encreaſing or decreaſing Sect or Sects in Churches. Only in ſome caſes the heats of them are rather to be permitted to coole by degrees; then that at once there ſhould be endeavours uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh them.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. In the laſt place then, the Magiſtrate,<note place="margin">Laſt of all, the Magiſtrate hath the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Right and Power in all theſe things.</note> who hath the Supream and ultimate power of laying a reſtraint upon the divulging of mens opinions in the general, hath alſo the ſame power of doing the ſame thing as to all theſe particular ways and caſes, relating to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging of them, which have been mentioned: Eſpecially, as to the

And he is the Supream Supervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor in every <hi>Eccleſiaſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> who is purely Eccleſiaſtical; and who by vertue of the Inſtitution of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and according to his being indued with ſuitable <hi>Direct power in ſpirituals</hi> from him, is bound <hi>ex officio</hi> to look after the affairs of the diſtinct Societie of the Chriſtian Church in the General; beſides what more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular powers he may, at any time, and in any more particular Mode of National ſociety, derive from the ſupream Magiſtrate, principally for the ſake of the <hi>Conſiſtency of Religion with Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In the interim, this office he is ordinarily to ſpend his time in, and to look after, and to mannage it with great care and prudence: and that becauſe, without a due overſight of affairs, the particular Church Powers cannot be rightly applied and brought to effect, as was ſaid; and without the Application of them aright,<note place="margin">Hic Supra §. <hi>1.</hi>
                  </note> there can be no well-being for the Church-Societie. So then, the due diſcharge of this great office of truſt is fundamental to the well-being of the Chriſtian Church; beſides alſo what reſpect it may have to the welfare of Civil Government and all Humane Society in any ſtate or Common-weale. There are ſome who mix this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Ordinary Eccleſiaſtical Superviſorſhip; and who, by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the perſons called <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> do divide and ſhare the Eccleſiaſtical Superviſorſhip betwixt Laicks and Eccleſiaſticks.

The Authentick and Publick lawful Interpreters then in any National Church, and in relation either to its Temporary or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual occaſions to the Original Divine, or the Derivative Humane Canon of Doctrines, or to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or any other more deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Writings, or other matters framed from it, and according to it; are of divers ſorts. They are either <hi>Supreme,</hi> or <hi>Subordinate.</hi> The Supreme is the Chief Magiſtrate, as ſhall be further evidenc'd by and by. And the Subordinate are, ordinarily and moſt properly, in relation to matters directly concerning Religion; the <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks</hi> or <hi>Church-men</hi> in any Society: And that in their ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59463:164"/> and according to the Deſignation and intent of their Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Function in the general, and alſo as deputed in Ordinary by the Supreme Magiſtrate mentioned. And in relation to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more directly concerning Government, he hath his Counſel, or Miniſters of State (of what kind ſoever) ordinarily to attend him. Yet, <hi>Omnium tamen harum &amp; Interpretandi Scientia, &amp; Actiones apud Collegium Pontificum erat,</hi> ſayes <hi>Pomponius</hi> in the <hi>Digeſts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D. De Orig. jur. <hi>L. 2.</hi> ¶. Deinde. Ex his.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Colledge Pontifical, amongſt the Romans, had ſo great vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhewed to them, as that they had the power of Interpretation committed to them, even in Civil Actions and Cauſes.</hi> And this might be either for more Special or common reaſons. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Interpreters then again are ſuch either in <hi>Conjunction one with another,</hi> as in the Church Repreſentative; or elſe <hi>ſimply,</hi> and by themſelves, as in more ordinary Caſes. And in both theſe Capacities, they are ſo many times in Conjunction one way or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Civil Magiſtrate: And in each of theſe Capacities again their Interpretations alſo are ſuch either <hi>pro tempore,</hi> or <hi>pro perpetuo.</hi> And thoſe <hi>pro perpetuo,</hi> and fixedly, are ordinarily in Writing. And thoſe <hi>pro tempore,</hi> and upon any temporary occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are either in <hi>Word,</hi> or in <hi>Writing.</hi> And the Interpretations of each of theſe ſorts and degrees of Interpreters, ought to have their due repute and credit amongſt men. The Liberties however, which have been heretofore mentioned as belonging to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of any National Church, in reſpect to theſe Interpretations,<note place="margin">

               <p n="3">III. But amongſt all theſe ſorts of Interpretors, it is the <hi>Supreme Interpreter</hi> ſtill, who ſtands in the moſt important relation, as was ſaid, to the matters of an Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity; and whoſe office therefore is here moſt deſignedly treated of. And the Cheif Magiſtrate hath his Right and Title to this his Supreme interpretor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip derived to him from all the three ſorts of Lawes, which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable amongſt men, <hi>(viz.)</hi> both from the Law Natural, and the Divine, and that of Nations alſo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Law Natural. And it dictates his Right and Title to it, evidently and neceſſary, for the preſervation of his Publick Charge in all the parts of it, and eſpecially in that of the Conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Religion with Government: Which, how eaſily it may be ſubverted, and the Magiſtrate wronged and ruined by any other, if he ſhall have the faculties of this Supreme Interpretorſhip in his hands, it was but now mentioned. And what a Temptation alſo the Magiſtrates Temporal Splendors, and his Crown and Dominions will be to any one, ſo to attempt the <hi>Ruine</hi> of him, it needs not be here mentioned neither. And this more particular <hi>Right</hi> and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then of the Chief Magiſtrate is one Principal part of his <hi>Indirect Power in Spirituals;</hi>

                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. §. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.</note> and which is more eſpecially neceſſary for the retaining his more General Right above mentioned, of the framing his Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity in any Society.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:59463:165"/>2. In like manner alſo is this <hi>Supreme Interpretorſhip</hi> of the chief Magiſtrate dictated by the Divine Law of both the Teſtaments and Books of God. So in the Old, in relation to the Kingdome of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> At the delivery of the Law, at mount <hi>Sinai: Moſes</hi> was Gods Meſſenger moſt eminently Authorized, and went down, ſaith the Text, unto the People, and ſpake unto them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.25. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>But let not the Prieſts and the People break through to come up unto the Lord, leaſt he break forth upon them.</hi> And it was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly fixed for a perpetual Law in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> that the Supreme Judg of Controverſies (as well Sacred as Civil) ſhould be the great <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> or Kings Councel, aſſiſtant to him, meant by <hi>the Judge in thoſe dayes, Deut.</hi> 17.9. <hi>and</hi> 12. And this was the <hi>Right</hi> which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.8. <hi>Moreover,</hi> ſayes the Text, <hi>in Jeruſalem did Jehoſaphat ſet of the Levites, and of the Prieſts, and of the Chief of the Fathers of Iſrael, for the Judgment of the Lord, and for Controverſies, when they returned to Jeruſalem.</hi> And afterwards <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. He deputed <hi>Amarieh,</hi> principally in all Sacred, and <hi>Zeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> in all Divine matters. And who knowes not but that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority in <hi>Iſrael</hi> did exerciſe the Supreme Power of Judging of all kinds of Superſtitions, and Idolatries, Blaſphemies, Hereſies, and even of Prophecies, and Miracles, and the like? See <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.28, 29, 30, 31, 32. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 17.2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c. Deut.</hi> 18.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c. Levit.</hi> 24.10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we look into the New Teſtament, the ſame thing is aſſented to, and approved of by it: and although the Chriſtian Church, at the Writing of it, were not National, yet it provides for its being National: It commands in the general, the <hi>giving unto Caeſar that which is Caeſars, Mat.</hi> 22.21. It appoints in the caſe of the Treſpaſs of a Brother, the <hi>telling it to the Church (i. e.)</hi> as dependent ultimately upon the Chief Magiſtrate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. It appoints <hi>Prayers to be made, for Kings, and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.2. and the like. And laſtly, the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when they practiſed the firſt Plantation, and ſetting up of the Chriſtian Religion, againſt the likings and Authority of the Governours of <hi>Judea,</hi> the Roman Emperors, and the like; it was in the reſerved Caſe of a particular command from Heaven preſſing them to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we look then further, to the Law and Cuſtomes of Nations; the ſame Tenour of practiſe alſo, we ſhall find to have been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every where obſerved, and in all Ages and humane Societies. And it is at leaſt a tacite compact generally amongſt them, that the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Prince have the power of the Interpretation and judgment of any publick Doctrines of Religion whatſoever, and of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and eſtabliſhment of them in his Eccleſiaſtical Uniformity. So in the admiſſion and eſtabliſhment of their own Publick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59463:165"/> at home: And in all Embaſſies about the Admiſſion and eſtabliſhment of them abroad. So in the Intreaties and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of exil'd and diſperſed Nations; and who are not aſſociated locally under one Head: And ſo in any other of thoſe that are; and whether they do at any time treat or intercede, either that their Profeſſion of Religion may be only tolerated, or elſe eſtabliſhed authoritatively as national in any Society. And the humane Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, and other Monuments and Records abroad in the World, are full of the more direct inſtances in this matter. Amongſt the Greeks; The Senate of <hi>Athens,</hi> and the <hi>Areopagus,</hi> and other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, did debate formes of Religion, Blaſphemies againſt the Gods, divulging of Myſteries, and the like, both Sacred and Civil matters;<note place="margin">In Solone.

                  </gap>. <hi>And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever receive the Powers of Interpreting the Lawes from the People.</hi> Of the Roman State, ſayes <hi>Pomponius</hi> in the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> that in the beginning of the City, <hi>Omnia manu a Regibus Gubernabantur; all things were governed immediatly by the Kings.</hi> And afterwards, when publick Authority had fetched Lawes from <hi>Greece;</hi> it alſo gave the Power of the Interpretation of them.

And up and down in the <hi>Code</hi> and <hi>Novels</hi> of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> Confeſſions of Faith are eſtabliſhed by the Law Imperial; Hereſies are Anathamiz'd, and the like. The imperial deciſion of matters, is ſtiled an Oracle. The Emperour's ſentence called a Divine Sentence. And finally, the Supreme Interpretation of all Lawes, both Divine and Humane, both Sacred and Civil, is claimed as a right belonging only to the Prince. <hi>Inter aequitatem juſque in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſitam interpretationem nobis ſolis et oportet et licet inſpicere. It
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59463:166"/> belongs to us only, both out of duty, and by our office, to have the inſpection into the Interpretation betwixt the equity and letter of the Law,</hi> ſayes the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> And the Emperours <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> and <hi>Martian, Leges Sacraciſſimae, quae conſtringunt hominum vitas, intelligi ab omnibus debent. Si quid vero in iiſdem Legibus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fortaſſis obſcurius fuerit, oportet id ab imperatoria interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one pate fieri.

Laſt of all, If we look abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the more modern practiſes of Countries, and ſuch as are at this day amongſt the <hi>Mahometans;</hi> although the <hi>Chief Mufti</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> be <hi>Inſtar Papae noſtri, vel Patriarchae Graecorum.

And it is ſaid, that for not Interpreting according to the mind of his Maſter, not long ſince, the <hi>Mufti</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was degraded and ſent to be <hi>Mufti</hi> at <hi>Damaſco;</hi> and that he died by the way in his journey thither, at <hi>Aleppo.</hi> The like to this up and down in <hi>Europe</hi> is the <hi>Right</hi> exerciſed by all Princes in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wayes,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> Tit <hi>5.</hi> De Regim.

And the Princes only do appoint and conſtitute the Ordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of Lawes. So ſaith the <hi>Ordines Suſitaniae, Fragoſus,</hi> and others, that it is commanded to the Judges; that where the Lawes of the Kingdome, and the Civil Law, are deficients they ſhould have recourſe to the Gloſſes of <hi>Accurſius</hi> and to <hi>Bartolus;</hi> and by the Laws of the Kingdome of <hi>Castile,</hi> the Judges are appointed to give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according according to the Opinions of <hi>Johannes Andreas,</hi> and <hi>Panormitanus,</hi> in the Law Canon; and of <hi>Bartolus</hi> and <hi>Baldus,</hi> in the Civil Law. And in <hi>Germany,</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth,</hi> in his <hi>Criminal Conſtitutions,</hi> commanded the <hi>Colledges</hi> of Civil Law Doctors, in the Univerſities appointed by him for Interpretation, to be Conſulted, if any thing doubtful or obſcure ſhould occurre in thoſe his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. Finally, by the general conſent of the Civilians, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Interpretation, is held to be Authoritative and neceſſary, and ſuch as muſt be obeyed, upon the only account of Command and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power. And indeed whoſe ſhould the Supreme Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Lawes be, but theirs who made them, and who have the Legiſlative power in their hands? and that rightly and neceſſarily; ſince the interpretations of Lawes are Lawes themſelves, in effect, and in the deciſion and determination of all cauſes by them. And the ſame reaſon there is for theſe things, and much more in Lawes
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59463:166"/> Eccleſiaſtical then in Lawes Civil; things being weighed on both ſides, and proportionably in reſpect to both. And whitherſoever we will look abroad in the World; and whereſoever any Canons of Doctrine or Liturgies are eſtabliſhed in Churches;<note place="margin">The Oppoſers of it Taxed.</note> we ſhall find the Authority, that firſt conſtituted them, retaining alſo the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Right of the Interpretation of them.</p>
